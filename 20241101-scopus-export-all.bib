	abstract = {Urban development is a key driver of global biodiversity loss. “Green” infrastructure is integrated to offset some impacts of development on ecosystem quality by supporting urban biodiversity, a prominent example being green roofs. The effects of green infrastructures on urban biodiversity are not well understood and poorly included in life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Here, we present a novel methodology that quantifies the local impact of green infrastructures on terrestrial biodiversity—demonstrated here for sedum roofs in London, UK—and integrates within LCA. It relates energy provision by plants to the metabolic requirements of animals to determine what species richness (number of species) and species abundance (number of individuals) are supported. We demonstrate this methodology using a case study, comparing the life cycle impact of developing 18 buildings, with either asphalt concrete or sedum roofs, on ecosystem quality. We found the sedum roofs (0.018 km2) support 53 species (673 individuals), equivalent to 1.3% of the development's life cycle impacts on ecosystem quality. Complete offsetting requires considerable reduction in transport use throughout the development's lifetime, and lower environmental impact material selection during construction (contributing 98% and 2%, respectively). The results indicate sedum roofs offer minor impact mitigation capacities in the context of urban development, and this capacity is limited for all green infrastructures by species richness in local species pools. This paper demonstrates the potential and limitations of quantifying terrestrial biodiversity offsets offered by green infrastructures alongside urbanization, and the need for realistic expectations of what role it might play in sustainable urban design. © 2024 The Authors.

Assessing the conservation effectiveness of the WDPA is important for understanding the current status of global biodiversity conservation and formulating corresponding improvement measures. However, previous studies still lack to assess the conservation effectiveness of the WDPA at a global scale with a human activities and habitat quality perspective. Here, we construct a framework for evaluating conservation effectiveness from the perspective of human activities and habitat quality, and attempt to assess the conservation effectiveness of the WDPA. The study results found that habitat quality in the WDPA has not degraded over the past two decades and that human-land relationship have been further harmonized. However, trends in the impact of human activities on habitat quality varied across analytical models. The findings of this study affirm the conservation effectiveness of the WDPA but also raise some vigilance, which can provide scientific advice for policymakers further to improve the differentiated protective measures of the WDPA. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Small farms constitute the vast majority of agricultural holdings in the world. Therefore, there are the questions of how the small farm sector should evolve and whether economic and environmental goals can be pursued simultaneously. The main objective of this article is to identify potential improvements (a non-radial inefficiency slack) in small farms in Central and Eastern Europe with different types of farming under an environmentally adjusted production function. Based on this, potential development pathways for small farms are assumed. A hybrid data envelopment analysis meta-frontier super-efficiency model with environmental proxies reflecting biodiversity (i.e. crops diversity, grassland, orchards, vineyards) and undesirable outputs (such as soil organic matter loss and GHG sources) and an uncontrollable policy input is used on a country-representative sample of 2320 small farms in four countries: Poland, Romania, Serbia, and Moldova. We found that the more technically efficient small farms are also usually more sustainable when socially desirable criteria were considered. Crops small farms can evolve in two directions: “landscape guardians” and “artisanal (traditional) framers.” Livestock farms could either maintain the status quo or choose an exit pathway. Mixed farms are likely to become landscape guardians, while a sustainable intensification path is open for 20% of farms that specialize in permanent crops. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Forest ecosystems play a crucial role in global carbon sequestration, with the majority of forest carbon being stored in biomass. However, it remains unclear at the national scale to what extent forest biomass depends on soil and climatic conditions, as well as tree species diversity. In this study, we identified and grouped these factors using a classical geographical dividing line, the Hu-line, which divides China into East and West regions characterized by obvious differences in natural conditions and vegetation distribution. We assessed the possible effects of forest species diversity, climatic conditions, and soil environment on the magnitude of forest biomass and carbon sequestration potential by integrating China's 2009–2018 forest inventory data with environmental information. We tested these effects using a structural equation model. Forest biomass was mainly influenced by environmental factors in the West (effect sizes soil N, soil pH, soil P, mean annual precipitation and temperature: −0.50, 0.41, 0.10, 0.04, 0.34) and by species diversity in the East (effect sizes −0.26 and 0.44 in the west and east, respectively). Our results demonstrated the non-negligible influence of forest species diversity on forest biomass. Therefore, through a comprehensive consideration of the interactions between climate, soil, and water resource availability, forest management and cleaner production plans will assist policymakers in designing a rational framework for future forest conservation measures. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Biodiversity loss, driven by human activities, significantly affects the environment, human societies, and economies. Using the extended multi-regional input–output (EEMRIO) and life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques, we offer insights into how these methodologies can be used to inform financial decisions related to biodiversity focusing on two key aspects: biodiversity impacts and ecosystem service dependencies. Our method combines spatially explicit characterization factors from LC-IMPACT with the Global Resource Input-Output Assesment (GLORIA) database to estimate biodiversity impacts. As a case study we assess the biodiversity impact of the MSCI All Country World Index (MSCI ACWI) which consist of about 3000 large- and mid-sized companies, from 23 developed and 24 emerging countries. The results demonstrate that most of the biodiversity impact is caused in the Americas, followed by Asia, despite its low representation in the index's country weight (6%). Europe shows the least impact. These results emphasize the need to account for global supply chain linkages as products sold in one country might have significant biodiversity impacts elsewhere due to sourcing of production inputs. Second, our results identify the main determinants of the index's impact: land use, followed by water stress and climate change. Although most of the impact is localized in few sectors, the distinct characteristics of these sectors require industry-specific mitigation approaches. Finally, double materiality results show both, the influence companies have on biodiversity and the reciprocal effects. Companies neglecting these impacts risk financial setbacks, making it a crucial concern for investors. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Modified landscapes for agricultural and urban development have caused the loss of natural habitats, potentially exacerbating species extinction. Addressing this issue requires understanding the potential conflicts from protecting threatened species and clearing land (for farming or urbanization). This study evaluates such conflicts, termed conflict risk (CR) between landscape modification and species conservation as well as its changes under climate change, using Species Distribution Models, conservation planning tools, and scenario prediction. The findings highlight the Sichuan Basin and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau as critical habitats for threatened species, underscoring the high urgency for conservation efforts. CR hotspots cover ∼16.3% of China's terrestrial area, with those driven by agricultural expansion concentrated in the Sichuan Basin and Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, and those driven by urban development in major river deltas. Climate change is projected to alter the conflict risk across regions, with CR hotspots estimated to decrease by 15.9–21.6% and relocate eastward. Central Xinjiang and central Shaanxi are expected to encounter increased CR across scenarios, whereas southeastern China would see a notable rise in CR specifically under the SSP1-RCP2.6 scenario. Combining these projections with specific land drivers provides a robust basis for balancing species conservation with land management needs, offering crucial insights for biodiversity preservation and sustainable land use planning. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Evaluating terrestrial ecosystem health is beneficial for promoting vegetation protection and restoration efforts. This study analyzed the spatial-temporal evolution of three landscapes (i.e., natural/semi-natural vegetation, agricultural vegetation, and non-vegetation landscapes) of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) from 1990 to 2020, and explored their impacts for terrestrial ecosystem health (EH) which was estimated by vigor-organization-resilience (V–O-R) model. The results demonstrated that terrestrial EH improved during 1990–2020 because of the increasing natural/semi-natural vegetation landscapes of >1000m and >25° areas. Regions of higher EH levels were the northern and eastern counties dominated by natural/semi-natural vegetation, while regions of lower EH levels were the middle counties dominated by agricultural and non-vegetation landscapes. The relationships between natural/semi-natural vegetation landscape and EH were positive, while agricultural and non-vegetation landscapes were negatively related to EH. Moreover, climate and socioeconomic factors exerted a negative correlation with EH, while soil and topography factors were positively correlated with EH. Our findings support the importance of considering landscape dynamics in promoting ecological restoration and enhancing EH, providing scientific references for ensuring sustainable development of the TGRA and other similar ecological vulnerable regions. © 2024},

	abstract = {The oxidative capacity of ozone makes it a highly effective biocide, widely used in the food and processing industry, as well as in drinking water plants. In a context of tighter restrictions on the use of synthetic plant protection products at the regulatory level, wineries are looking for alternative methods to control diseases, making the application of ozonated water an option to consider. To determine the environmental sustainability of this alternative vineyard disease control treatment, an environmental impact assessment was conducted using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. The assessment was carried out in a vineyard located in the D.O. Rías Baixas of Galicia, located in northwestern Spain. The analysis was conducted on the basis of two functional units: i) 1 kg of grapes and ii) 1 ha of land managed and using a cradle-to-gate boundary system. Ten impact categories were assessed using the ReCiPe method, except for the water scarcity indicator, which was quantified using AWARE. The environmental sustainability of the vineyard was further analyzed by measuring its carbon sequestration potential to obtain a more complete environmental profile. The RothC-26.3 model was chosen to estimate absolute carbon sequestration and annual sequestration rate from 2020 to 2040. Since the ozone-only scenarios lost all harvest, no environmental assessment was performed for such scenarios. For the remaining scenarios, the findings suggest that those using a combination of ozonated water and fungicides have the worst environmental performance due to notable reductions in grape yield and more frequent disease control interventions, particularly in certain scenarios. When evaluating environmental performance per hectare of land managed, the scenario using ozonated water with a limited number of disease control interventions exhibited the most favorable environmental profile, primarily due to reduced use of fungicides and disease control passes. In addition, the main contributors to the vineyard environmental profile identified were diesel fuel combustion during field operations, fertilizer use and production, and irrigation. In addition, the research indicates that the vineyard sequesters carbon annually, but this alone is insufficient to offset its greenhouse gas emissions. However, it is estimated that through the application of more appropriate soil management practices, the vineyard could achieve carbon neutrality and potentially increase soil carbon stocks over time. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Seaweed farming is promoted as a facet of the Blue Economy that may provide food, support local livelihoods, bolster marine biodiversity, and sequester carbon. While the potential for each of these benefits is often studied in isolation, here we explore the potential for ‘holistic’ management, which realizes all four benefits simultaneously. Applying a stock and flow model to different environmental and socio-economic scenarios, we simulate ten years of operations on a one-hectare kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) farm. We explore trade-offs among the food, livelihoods, marine biodiversity, and carbon sequestration benefits of each scenario to identify the management conditions under which holistic seaweed farming can be achieved. Our results demonstrate that holistic seaweed farming is possible under many – but not all – scenarios, and that holistic management is distinct from management that prioritizes maximizing any single benefit, frequently requiring a reduction in financial benefits to maintain others. Proper farm placement and robust management in marine environments will be critical for seaweed industries to support multiple sustainable development objectives at once. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic deoxygenation of freshwater systems has attracted widespread global attention due to its potential to threaten ecosystem biodiversity, increase internal nutrient loading, and enhance greenhouse gas emissions. However, the exploration of effective, economical, and green solutions available to combat hypoxia and its impacts on freshwater remains a longstanding challenge. Herein, oxygen-carrying dual-modified sediment-based biochar (O-KN-SBC) was developed as a new approach to sustainably restore hypoxic freshwater and synchronously mitigate methane (CH4) emission. The O-KN-SBC was observed in column incubation experiments to elevate dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration by 6 times and reduce CH4 emission by 18 times compared to the control. Electrochemical analysis confirmed the ability of modified biochar to promote electron transfer and its role as an electron shuttle to mediate biological processes. Microbial analysis suggested that the restored oxygen-enriched ambiance could greatly promote the expression of pmoA gene with an 8-fold increase and the shift of methanotrophs from Type I dominance to Type I and II co-dominance. Last but not least, partial least squares path modeling revealed that in the presence of O-KN-SBC, CH4 fluxes had strong associations with functional genes namely pmoA and mcrA, which mainly depended on the ambient water quality (especially DO, nitrate, and organic carbon). Our study not only develops a promising approach to sustainably address hypoxia and warming related issues in freshwater systems, but also demonstrates the roles of water quality improvement and microbial community reconstruction in the greenhouse gas emission reduction process. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Understanding the driving factors of ecosystem services and biodiversity (ESB) is necessary for sustainable ecosystem management. Previous studies have analyzed many individual factors affecting ESB on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). However, there is limited knowledge on the scale dependence of the driving factors at different levels. In this study, we selected and assessed vegetation carbon uptake reduction (VCR), water supply index (WSI), and mean species abundance (MSA) on the QTP during 2000–2020, which can represent carbon sequestration, water yield ecosystem services, and biodiversity intactness, respectively. Then, we unutilized the hierarchical linear model (HLM) to determine the impacts of natural factors at the eco-functional zone level and socioeconomic factors at the city level on the three indices. The results showed that the spatial distribution of VCR and WSI had a generally gradual declining trend, and MSA had an increasing trend from the southeast to the northwest from 2000 to 2020. At the eco-functional zone level, degradation of forest and grassland had the greatest, most negative effects on carbon uptake and MSA. Potential evapotranspiration rather than precipitation had the strongest and most positive influence on the WSI. At the city scale, rural per capita net income, GDP, and meat production dominated the decrease in VCR, WSI, and MSA, respectively. The eco-functional zone was nested into the city, population, and economic controlled ESB mainly through its effect on land use, especially grassland. VCR and MSA were mainly affected by natural factors, while WSI was affected by socioeconomic factors. Overall, our study provides a reference for analyzing the multilevel factors that affect the sustainability of ESB. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

This study provides a first quantitative assessment of biodiversity risk exposure across the world's largest listed companies, compared with their adoption of biodiversity policies, through analysis of disclosures from a sample of 11,812 companies from 2004 to 2018. We find that companies have started responding strategically to biodiversity risk, with 29% having adopted a biodiversity policy by 2018. However, around $7.2 trillion of total enterprise value remains exposed to unmanaged biodiversity risk. Companies in sectors with material impacts on biodiversity tend to have high levels of response, but there is poorer responsiveness to material biodiversity dependency risks.

	abstract = {While many pesticides are detrimental to human health and the environment, drastically reducing their use and risks in agriculture has been set as a key target for global environmental policies. To this end, redesigning agroecosystems by increasing plant diversity at the cropping system and landscape levels is increasingly seen as imperative. Positive evidence that diversifying agroecosystems suppresses pests is accumulating and many ecological mechanisms driving pest suppression are known. Yet, variability in effects, risks of failure, and the limited adoption of diversification practices, call for improving diversification science. The overarching challenge lies in shifting from homogeneous production systems targeting yield at the cost of high input uses, to complex biodiversity-based environments resilient to pest pressure and delivering multifunctional performances. Therefore, a new conceptual umbrella to guide future agroecosystem design is proposed, which consists of integrating four principles: (i) embracing complexity, by jointly considering the multiple pests and their enemies; (ii) considering traits, in mobilizing the functional grammar; (iii) stacking diversification practices, by strategically combining the multiple facets of plant diversity at multiple scales; (iv) translating ecological processes into socio-economic benefits to adopt a multifunctional perspective. While addressing the associated implications for science and research, the present review critically discusses how to mobilize the spatio-temporal cross-scale dependencies of interactions in agroecosystems. Promoting synergies and building on the functional complementarities of ecological processes is proposed as a way to strengthen agroecosystem resilience to pest outbreaks. © 2023 The Authors},

Extant approaches to measurement are relatively nascent and do not directly address the dynamic complexity that can cause abrupt ecosystem change. Measurement approaches largely overlook when transformational change may occur and how changes to biodiversity may influence its likelihood. We posit that corporate biodiversity impact measurement can be advanced by incorporating resilience thinking from the natural sciences. Resilience thinking can refocus measurement on how biodiversity contributes to an ecosystem's capacity to adapt to disturbances and avoid sudden, transformative change. We propose a set of seven key mechanisms that can inform measurement development across three biodiversity attributes: abundance, composition and distribution. To conclude, we discuss opportunities for accounting researchers to advance corporate biodiversity measurement approaches connected to ecosystem resilience. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity adopted the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (Kunming-Montreal GBF), which puts forward higher ecological conservation requirements for countries to carry out sound spatial planning to realize the ultimate vision of harmonious coexistence between humanity and nature. It is urgent to adopt a comprehensive and refined spatial planning method to provide spatial guidance for efficient actions. Ecological security patterns (ESP) are an integrated approach that effectively reduces the impact of production and daily life on nature, promoting regional ecological sustainability, which can provide efficient spatial planning support for Kunming-Montreal GBF implementation. Taking the Xishuangbanna tropical region as a research case, a biodiversity hotspot in China and the world, this study attempts to improve and optimize the ecological network construction process of the ESP research paradigm “ecological sources identification-ecological resistance surfaces construction-ecological corridors extraction" around higher ecological objectives, and further identifies the priority areas for ecological conservation and restoration. Overall, it has been determined the ecological network spaces of five species groups in the Xishuangbanna tropical region. Key biodiversity areas of 2768.19 km2 play an important maintenance role in the overall biodiversity and ecosystem services of the region, and 213 high importance and connectivity corridors that have significant contributions to the migration of species are determined. The priority areas for ecological conservation (2467.71 km2) and ecological restoration (514.67 km2) are further determined. This study provides a demonstration case for constructing an integrated ESP to maintain regional species and ecosystem stability, enhance integrity and connectivity, and further identify priority areas. For the Xishuangbanna tropical region and other global biodiversity hotspots, a systematic, comprehensive, and sustainable ecological management model should be established, where limited funding and resources for ecological actions should be directed to priority areas of the most valuable outcomes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Urban food consumption contributes significantly to global biodiversity loss. To ensure a sustainable food supply for the growing urban population a transformation of food production and consumption patterns is necessary. Here, options for reducing the food-related biodiversity footprint of Vienna (Austria), a high-income city in Europe were assessed regarding measures of product substitution, demand reduction through avoidance of waste and caloric overconsumption and a shift from imports to domestic production. The biodiversity footprints of 24 food consumption patterns were calculated with a life-cycle-assessment approach applying country- and primary biomass-specific factors for vertebrate species loss derived from a high-resolution global countryside species-area-relationship model that incorporates land-use intensity and spatially-explicit information on Vienna's source regions. Compared to the baseline food consumption in Vienna of 2010, diets with less animal products could reduce the footprint by 21%–43%, while waste reduction and adhering to the recommended caloric intake could reduce the footprint by 5% and 9%, respectively. Decreasing the demand for primary biomass under alternative diets could also free up domestic cropland and allow for reducing imports and relocating production from abroad to Austria. This could reduce Vienna's biodiversity footprint additionally by 5%–21%, depending on diet and demand level, due to comparatively higher yields and lower native species richness in Austria. Results further indicate that shifting towards a vegetarian diet requires the least product substitution per footprint reduction among the examined alternative diets. Substituting animal products with plant-based alternatives from area-efficient production systems located outside of biodiversity hotspots emerges as a promising strategy for Western cities to reduce their biodiversity footprint. © 2024 The Authors},

Direct potable reuse (DPR) has been considered a promising strategy to guarantee public supply in regions with severe problems with water scarcity and high-water demand. The success of reuse practices mainly depends on the triad technology, regulation, and public acceptance. This study investigated public acceptance as a technical parameter to assess the implementation feasibility of DPR in large cities of developing countries. Residents of Campinas City (São Paulo, Brazil) were consulted through a multiple-response questionnaire addressing sociodemographic aspects, personal environmental perceptions, and the acceptable uses for wastewater reuse. The results showed a low rejection rate (∼7%) to DPR despite this not being regulated in Brazil. A total of 47% of the volunteers declared that they would accept the DPR of domestic sewage after appropriate treatments and technologies approved by the World Health Organization (WHO), and 46% would accept it after more information. Age was an essential factor for DPR acceptance, being greater among those between 30 and 45 years old. No statistically significant differences in potable reuse acceptability were observed among participants' sex and self-declaration of race. The majority of volunteers (85%) considered water reuse very important, and most participants (51%) already practice non-potable household water reuse daily and do so out of environmental awareness. Trust in the water supply concessionaire was a key factor in DPR acceptance. This study is essential for discussing innovative public-oriented solutions to achieve water security in developing countries, especially considering the scarcity of investigations on DPR acceptability in South America. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Boron (B)-efficient sugarbeet can potentially adapt better to the B deficient soil environments, however the characteristics of root yield or quality and rhizosphere soil microbial dynamics associated with B-efficient beet roots are extremely understudied. This study aimed to clarify the root yield characteristics and rhizosphere microbial response of B-efficient sugarbeet variety under B deficiency. Pertinently, the findings of this study will contribute to the reduction of B resource consumption and cleaner production in sugarbeet planting management. The study utilized two sugarbeet varieties with different B utilization propensities and subjected them to normal and B deficient field conditions. Results demonstrated a reduction in the yield quality of both varieties under B deficiency, but the B-efficient variety exhibited a smaller reduction. Boron deficiency reduced the species richness and diversity of the rhizospheric microbial community, decreasing the relative abundance of Actinobacteriota, Acidobacteria, while increasing that of Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi and the pathogenic fungus Fusarium. The proportion of dominant bacterial was severely reduced in B-inefficient varieties (0.86%) compared to B-efficient varieties (0.14%). The efficient variety displayed higher species richness of rhizospheric soil fungi and a higher abundance and proportion of dominant flora, i.e., Bacillus and Actinobacteria, albeit lower abundance of the pathogenic fungi Mortierellomycota and Rhizoctonia. These advantages allowed B-efficient sugarbeet variety to maintain higher yield levels under B deficit. Overall, under B-deficient conditions, B-efficient variety of sugarbeet was less limited than B-inefficient one, and its rhizosphere microbial communities were more conducive to sugarbeet yield in terms of composition and function. Succinctly, this study revealed the advantages of rhizosphere soil microorganisms associated with B-efficient beet under B-deficient environments and provided the theoretical basis for reducing boron fertilizer application to protect the ecosystem and realize green and clean agricultural production, particularly of sugar beet. © 2024},

	abstract = {Biodiversity is associated with functional protection, adaptation to external conditions, and ecosystem resilience. Therefore, maintaining forest ecosystems with high biodiversity is essential for improving resistance and resilience to disturbances. In addition to the ecological factors influencing forest ecosystems, various socio-economic factors associated with forests can influence the ecosystem. However, socio-economic impacts on forest biodiversity have rarely been addressed. In this study, we investigated whether tree species diversity (TSD) of forest stands varies with ownership status (national vs. private forests). In addition, selected ecological (stand characteristics, site conditions, and climate) and socio-economic (regional forest management sectors, population, forestry population, forest coverage, and forestry income) factors influencing TSD were determined using data from the National Forest Inventory in South Korea. National forests had higher TSD than private forests, reflecting differences in management objectives. Among ecological factors, stand structural diversity (SDivI) was the most influential in both national and private forests. Socio-economic factors, such as population, forest coverage, forest income, and forest management bodies, significantly influenced the TSD, although the impact was smaller compared to ecological factors. Our results suggest that securing stand growth and development is essential for increasing stand structural diversity, which leads to an increase in TSD. Furthermore, our study shows that socio-economic factors can influence forest conditions over time. To better understand the factors influencing the state of forests and manage forests sustainably in the future, collaborative research bridging ecological and sociological fields is necessary. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

It furthermore investigates how activity and tool adoption as well as risk assessments vary with firm size and across industries, and with implementing environmental management systems. The analysis finds tensions between risk perception and activities pursued for biodiversity protection, largely because firms shy away from substantive action.

	abstract = {Deforestation is a complex environmental problem that has eluded a series of public policies and private-sector interventions. The need to develop effective solutions to this problem is urgent because unabated deforestation exacerbates climate change, biodiversity loss, human rights violations, displacement of Indigenous communities, and breakouts of zoonotic diseases. This paper focuses on corporate-led efforts to stop deforestation and identifies four reasons behind their failure: global trade and supply-chain obscurity, power dynamics in supply chains, neglected consumption in emerging economies, and diluted goal setting. We call upon corporate sustainability scholars, specifically in entrepreneurship, marketing, strategy, and supply-chain management domains, to dedicate efforts to develop novel corporate sustainability initiatives that can address the complex, rampant, and stubborn challenge of deforestation. We propose three broad areas of research to advance scholarship on the role of corporate sustainability in stopping deforestation: zero-deforestation supply chains, zero-deforestation consumption, and nature-positive business models. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Modern-day firms are under extreme pressure from diverse stakeholders to integrate environmentalism, mainly sustainable, social, and environmental ingenuities like biodiversity initiatives, into their business strategy. Collaborative arrangements in the form of business groups can positively influence sustainable development and environmental ingenuities by adhering to environmental policies and regulations and pursuing environmental orientation as they have a higher political or social visibility. However, such collaborations may negatively influence ecological and carbon footprints as their stronger political legitimacy means that they are less worried about undertaking legitimation activities in the drive toward environmental protection and restoration, such as enhanced sustainable social and environmental performance. This paper adds to the emerging conflicting business strategy and environment literature to resolve whether corporate's collaborative actions protect the environment or further deteriorate it in the form of increased or decreased sustainable social and environmental performance. Using a large sample of 21,086 firm-year observations from 2010 to 2018 in China (the world's biggest polluter), we find a negative and significant relationship between corporate's collaborative actions and sustainable social and environmental performance, implying that such collaborative arrangements have worse sustainable social and environmental performance than non-collaborative (individual) firms. The findings highlight vital guidelines in framing stratagems about ecological protection and restoration and effectively improving the environmental footprints of the firms. Our results constitute the interests of policymakers and controllers concerned with evaluating initiatives pertaining to ecological protection and sustainable development among the collaboratively managed enterprises. © 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Applying Coase's financial decision-making theory based on cost, revenues, and risks, the article analyzes literature and current developments of biodiversity finance and green finance to evaluate why financial decision-making is incentivized to ignore biodiversity risks and mostly fails to maximize biodiversity conservation or nature-positive finance. Based on the identified gaps, the article develops four principles to integrate biodiversity into financial decision-making: (1) regulation must set limits on nature's exploitation, as finance only values limited aspects of nature as “bankable,” while the destruction of other parts are without negative or positive value to the investor; (2) biodiversity-related financial risk evaluation needs focus on local risks due to the local nature of biodiversity impacts and dependencies (in comparison, e.g., to climate finance's global risks); (3) scale biodiversity finance utilizing its secondary benefits, particularly in conjunction with climate finance; (4) biodiversity finance development needs to be co-led and championed by financial decision-makers.

	abstract = {In the context of an increasingly severe ecological crisis and accelerating ecological civilization construction, the specific regional differences as well as the natural environment of China restrict the uniform population distribution and the social economy's spatial layout, forming a large and widely distributed wilderness. The post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) takes the protection of wilderness areas as one of the key conservation goals and brings new opportunities for wilderness protection. Objective and accurate identification of the spatial range of wilderness and the determination of the focus of wilderness protection are significant for carrying out resource and environmental carrying capacity evaluations, biodiversity conservation, and national park system construction. At present, fewer studies pay attention to wilderness area identification and protection in China. In this study, we used the MaxEnt and Marxan models to establish a framework to identify the spatial distribution and conservation priorities of China's wilderness as well as guide wilderness conservation. The wilderness areas in China show a large-scale, concentrated distribution in space and a small, scattered distribution. From 2000 to 2020, the wilderness area decreased from 3.6323 million km2 in 2000 to 2.9142 million km2 in 2020, and the wilderness area reduction rate from 2000 to 2010 was greater than that in 2010–2020. From 2000 to 2020, the center of gravity of the wilderness area shifted 893.5 km to the southwest. Wilderness center of gravity relocated from Pingluo County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region to Delingha City, Qinghai Province. Considering conservation objectives and conservation costs, we determined that the wilderness area in urgent need of protection is 55,100 km2, accounting for 1.8 % of the total wilderness area. It is mainly distributed in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (13,000 km2), Yunnan Province (12,000 km2), and Sichuan Province (5300 km2). This methodological framework can provide an important reference for governments in dealing with global climate change, maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem diversity, and promoting sustainable human development. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

In contrast to these findings, surveys among companies find that biodiversity receives least priority among all sustainability issues. This raises the question about barriers for corporate biodiversity management, available accounting and management approaches and the role of research to overcome these barriers as well as to motivate managers and enable change. This conceptual paper maps biodiversity management as an emerging research field and highlights the importance of management accounting to support effective corporate biodiversity management. We propose a framework for managers to assess what their impact is on biodiversity and what the impact is of biodiversity on their businesses. The framework helps managers to identify how their businesses are impacted by biodiversity and how they can contribute to stopping biodiversity loss and to regenerating biodiversity.

Inconsistencies may be introduced, however, when high-resolution characterization factors (CFs) are aggregated so as to match the low spatial granularity of MRIO models. These aggregation errors are greater when CFs are aggregated via proxies, such as ecoregion land shares, instead of based on spatially explicit elementary stressor flows. Here, we describe our approach to tailoring application-specific CFs for use in MRIO studies. We apply a global agricultural production model, Spatial Production Allocation Model (MapSPAM), with the LCIA database, LC-IMPACT, to create crop-specific national CFs. We investigated i) if the differing aggregation approaches and the increased spatial explicitness of the constructed CFs deviate substantially from those in LC-IMPACT, and ii) what the resulting consequences for national production and consumption-based biodiversity footprints are when combining the tailor-made CFs with the EXIOBASE MRIO model. For the year 2020, we observe an increase in global production-based biodiversity impacts of 23.5% for land use when employing crop-specific CFs. © 2024 The Author(s).

In light of this, we combined multiple environmental factors to construct a global SB dataset with a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° from 2000 to 2019. We determined that the global mean SB value was 0.66 during 2000–2019, and it slowly increased at a rate of 6.24 × 10−4/yr. The highest SB value (1.20) occurred within the Amazon Plain. Among the climate factors, temperature (T) was found to be responsible for the majority of the SB changes, accounting for approximately 40% of them. Compared to the results of other studies, our findings indicated that the SB increased across all types of land use and that urbanization had a positive impact on the increase in the SB. However, the most significant increase occurred in the pasture/range land. Precipitation (P) had similar effects on the SB in the pasture/range land and unmanaged grass/shrubland, while the areas with sparse or no vegetation experienced significant variations in temperature. These findings provide additional insights into the global pattern of SB and highlight the role of climate and land use changes in driving global and regional changes in SB. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Transport expansion is detrimental to natural ecosystems and yet to what extent it can impact nearby alpine ecosystems is not well understood. This case study in Qinghai–Tibet railway and highway explores the biophysical effects of transport infrastructure in terms of remote sensing-based greenness, wetness, dryness, and heat according to a space-for-time substitution method. We estimate highly diverse changes across road sections in all the indices from both multiyear-mean and long-term perspectives, and no clear biophysical gradients with distance away from the transport lines, except for a gradual decrease in multiyear-mean heat and wetness. In a 500-m buffer zone, those indices on average are 0.1–15.7% lower or higher than the references and the disparities increase or decrease significantly from 2000 to 2021 alongside 15–48% of the transport lines. We further find that the estimated biophysical changes depend strongly on the reference conditions and the elevation gradients nearby the roads. Also, the road sections surrounded by some urban/crop lands show much more frequent “significant” trends than the others, confirming strong land use effects on the biophysical dynamics in alpine regions. Nevertheless, it remains open to debate to what extent transportation contribute the land use activities near the roads. We argue that highways and railways unlikely strongly impact the biophysical conditions in alpine regions due to small road width, widespread nature reserves, various protective measures, and low accessibility to surroundings if they are fenced. Our results highlight the small biophysical impacts of transport infrastructure on roadside natural ecosystems in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and suggest prioritized attention to the direct damages to soil and vegetation by transport construction and the habitat disruption, biodiversity change, and road kills by transport operation for developing an environment-friendly transport system. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Available environmental flow assessment methods are not able to integrate the impacts of flow regime on the fish biodiversity which means improving these methods is necessary. This study proposes a novel approach to assess environmental flow regime in which the fish biodiversity index is simulated in the structure of the environmental flow assessment for protecting the fish biodiversity values in the case study. Due to considerable impact of water quality parameters as well as physical flow parameters, two combined physical flow and water quality indices were considered as the inputs of simulating fish biodiversity index. Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) as well as hydraulic simulation were applied to simulate combined indices of physical flow and water quality. Moreover, a multiple linear regression (MLR) model was utilized for simulating the fish biodiversity index. Due to necessity of simulating natural flow regime in the representative river reach, soil and water assessment tool as a known hydrological tool was applied as well. According to evaluation indices of the case study, ANFIS model as well as SWAT and MLR are reliable to assess environmental flow considering the fish biodiversity. The minimum environmental flow in the study area was assessed 40% of mean annual flow in which the difference between fish biodiversity index between the natural flow and environmental flow is less than 10%. However, significant improvement of water quality is a prerequisite before implementing the proposed environmental flow regime. High computational complexities is one of the weaknesses of the proposed method. © 2024 The Authors},

This emphasis shifted in the 1970s as the field turned towards economics for insights. Strategy scholars began to address how market- and industry-level considerations, such as performance, price, and competition, were pursued by firms. By applying macro-level principles and assumptions analogically to a more micro-level of analysis, strategy scholars inadvertently committed what statisticians call an ecological fallacy. Educators and scholars in the field of Strategy started to accept the constructive consequences of growth, not only for the economy, but for every firm, without considering the implications for society and the natural environment. In so doing, Strategy scholarship inadvertently undermined its very ambition to advance social aims. Our Point advocates for reconsideration of the field's foundations so as to remediate the ecological fallacy and to address the climate and biodiversity crises. The goal is to offer a brighter and more relevant future for our discipline. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {Norway aims to transform into a low-emission nation by 2050. However, the energy transition comes with challenges, as expanding renewable energy infrastructure requires significant land areas, which raises concerns about associated environmental impacts, particularly on species richness. The first system-wide life cycle assessment (LCA) approach that integrates multiple biodiversity models is presented, evaluating the current effects of renewable energy production and transmission in Norway. The impacts of Norwegian hydropower and onshore wind power plants are quantified, which contribute 98% of Norway's electricity generation. Additionally, the effects of power lines are included to assess the spatial origins of the biodiversity impacts derived from both energy production and transmission relative to where electricity was transmitted to and consumed in Norway. The analyses show that hydropower exerts the most substantial impact on species richness and that the electric grid affects mostly mammal richness due to habitat conversion and fragmentation. As energy production primarily originates in western-central and northern Norway, regions with low electricity generation, such as south-east Norway, import a substantial share of the biodiversity impacts for their energy consumption. However, integrating an international dimension is crucial, as multiple European countries exchange energy with Norway, and thus also contribute to the pressure on local species richness. The results present the current operational impacts on biodiversity caused by Norway's electricity system. Since Norway intends to increase its renewable energy production capacity in the coming decades, this approach can serve as an instrument for developing scenarios to assess the future construction of hydropower, onshore wind power, and power lines. It can help shape Norway's energy future, ensuring a holistic approach that integrates impacts on species diversity and promotes an environmentally friendly energy transition. While focused on Norway, the methodology is adaptable to other regions if the required data is available. © 2024 The Authors},

However, the hotspots in the intermediate transmission stages of global supply chains remain unknown. This study reveals critical transmission sectors and transactions of global embodied Hg emissions during 1995–2022. Results show that the critical transmission sectors and transactions of global embodied Hg emissions have been moving from developed (e.g., Japan and Russia) to developing (e.g., China and India) economies. Critical transmission sectors were primarily concentrated in the metal products, transportation, machinery and equipment manufacturing, and construction industries. Domestic transactions were the primary transmission pathways for embodied Hg emissions, with nearly half of these being intra-sectoral transactions. These findings can help policymakers develop transmission-bound Hg reduction policies and multi-level cooperation to support joint Hg emission reduction. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems face serious degeneration risks from anthropogenic activities, among which land use heterogeneity transformation is one of the main threats on aquatic biodiversity. However, the mechanisms by which land use heterogeneity affects fish community structure in aquatic ecosystems are still difficult to determine. The results of this study showed that we detected a total of 164 fish species during two seasons, with 97 fish species belonging to 15 orders, 31 families and 74 genera in dry season and 138 fish species belonging to 14 orders, 40 families and 98 genera in wet season. The intergroup differences between the upstream, midstream and downstream of the basin in dry season were smaller than those in wet season, and the species richness in wet season were higher than this in dry season. The values of β-diversity between the upstream and midstream regions was greater than downstream in dry season. The value of β-diversity between upstream and downstream regions was larger than in the midstream in wet season. It concluded that the β-diversity values were generally smaller in wet season than in dry season. Land use types on both sides of the Han River basin are mostly cropland, forest land and man-made surfaces. The results of calculating LUI and fish life history characteristics showed a greater correlation between K and M values in the dry water period and a greater correlation between PD50 and longevity in the rich water period. Moreover, we calculated the correlation between the land use index (LUI) and β-diversity NMDS values, respectively, showed a significant positive correlationship (0.712 in dry season; 0.742 in wet season). This research (a) obtained the spatial and temporal distribution of α-diversity and β-diversity data of fish in the whole basin using eDNA technology; (b) analyzed the relationship of land use heterogeneity on fish life history characteristics; and (c) revealed the correlation between land use index and β-diversity communities.

However, in the context of cultural homogenization and ecological decline, some high-value mountain areas are still not adequately protected, and some protected areas (PAs) even suffer from an imbalance between natural and cultural protection. To improve the coverage and conservation effectiveness of PAs in mountain areas, we propose a BCD evaluation approach to identify conservation gaps and prioritization, taking the Taishan Mountain Area (TMA) as a study case: first, we used four biodiversity factors (topographic diversity, geological diversity, ecosystem services, bird species distribution) and four cultural diversity factors (cultural landscape, intangible cultural heritage, traditional production modes, population and economy) to evaluate the BCD values; second, we generated a map of BCD hotspots and graded them into three levels; and finally, we compared the evaluation result with the PAs’ layout in the TMA and determined the conservation gap and prioritization. We find that 43.92% of the high BCD areas and 84.39% of the medium BCD areas within the mountain area are inadequately protected, and 10.79% of the low BCD areas may be overprotected, classifying the above conservation gaps as three priority levels of conservation. Our study indicates that the current PAs in mountain areas are insufficiently protected and urgently need to be expanded; (2) by analyzing the coupling relationship between biodiversity and cultural diversity, it is found that only 23.90% of the relationships between the two were coordinated or above in the TMA; (3) we propose the optimization strategies of four typical conservation gaps in the TMA; (4) we finally develop an integrated conservation model of biological and cultural values for different PA categories in mountain areas based on a gap analysis. Optimizing mountain conservation and management based on the BCD evaluation results is conducive to promoting the sustainable development of human beings and nature while guaranteeing the unbiased allocation of conservation resources in mountain areas. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

The present research considers these emerging systems from a consumer insights perspective. Using biodynamic (BD) agriculture as an exemplar, public opinions were explored in a multi-method and multi-national study with samples of consumers in the United Kingdom (UK), Australia, Singapore, and Germany. Across 1237 participants, the empirical findings pointed to largely positive attitudes. Between-country differences were minor, whereas consumer segmentation identified pan-national groups of people with attitudes that were, respectively, BD Positive (71%), BD Neutral (20%) or BD Negative (9%). In the BD Positive segment, consumers responded positively to the environmental and social aspects of BD agriculture, and it mattered to them that BD agriculture was a balanced and integrated approach to farming/food production. That is, they were not averse to the holistic/spiritual aspects that are unique to BD. Biodiversity, but also other aspects of environmental sustainability mattered more to consumers than social sustainability, notably worker welfare and community resilience. The research provides new consumer insights about biodynamics by being generic to BD agriculture rather than product specific (e.g., BD wine), and advances extant consumer research by jointly exploring environmental and social sustainability. Several practical implications emerge from the results. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The expansion of the electric grid is inevitable. Renewable energy is on the rise, and new transmission lines must be built to link new electricity production facilities with the local network. In addition, higher electricity demand due to electrification will lead to the growth of the distribution grid. However, further construction of power lines will affect the local biodiversity. Birds are especially vulnerable: every year, power lines cause the deaths of hundreds of millions of birds by collision and electrocution. Yet the environmental impacts of the electric grid in life cycle assessment (LCA) are limited to a few impact categories, failing to cover the area of protection for damages to ecosystem quality. We developed the first methodology to quantify power lines' collision and electrocution impacts on bird richness within LCA. We calculated the potentially disappeared fraction of species (PDF) by developing species–area relationships using high-resolution species distribution maps, species-specific characteristics, and the location of power lines and pylons. We applied our models to Norway, a country that aims to become a low-emission nation by 2050. The characterization factors ranged between 8.48 × 10−16 and 5.6 × 10−15 PDF*yr/kWh for collision and 3.27 × 10−18 and 1.66 × 10−16 PDF*yr/kWh for electrocution. Integrating power lines’ impacts on biodiversity in LCA is essential, as harmonized models can estimate the effects of electricity production alongside the impacts of electricity distribution. This brings us a step further in promoting a holistic assessment of energy systems. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {Anthropogenic activities have posed significant threats to water quality and aquatic organisms in urban rivers, yet the understanding of how planktonic and sedimentary algal communities respond to different levels of anthropogenic disturbances remains limited. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic investigation on the effects of three anthropogenic-disturbance levels (i.e., low in the upstream, moderate in the midstream, and high in the downstream reach) on algal communities in water and sediment of the Bahe River. Our results revealed that planktonic rather than sedimentary algae were more vulnerable to anthropogenic activities in the urban river. Notably, we found the lowest biodiversity and niche breadth of planktonic algae in the downstream subjected to the high anthropogenic stress. Furthermore, the lowest complexity and stability of co-occurrence patterns of planktonic algae as well as planktonic algae-bacteria were witnessed under the highest human disturbance. Anthropogenic activities, followed by physicochemical variables, geographical patterns, and bacteria co-occurring with algae, played essential roles in shaping the niche differentiation and community assembly of planktonic algae. This study suggested that anthropogenic disturbances (represented by nighttime light, gross domestic product, and impervious surface) can alter physiochemical conditions (such as nitrogen and phosphorus contents) and thereby damage algal compositions along the urban river, highlighting the importance of effective measures for mitigating the impacts of anthropogenic activities and protecting the ecological health of river systems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The intensive usage of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides helps Dutch arable farmers to secure high yields at low costs. However, this intensive arable production system also results in environmental degradation in terms of biodiversity loss and reduced soil and water quality. Adopting sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs) reduces arable farmers’ reliance on fertilisers and pesticides. Therefore, SAPs contribute to enhancing farm sustainability and resilience. Despite the promising potential of SAPs, their adoption rates remain low. We investigate which combinations of SAPs are jointly adopted in portfolios and how the adoption rate of SAP portfolios can be improved. Specifically, this paper aims to explore the relationship between knowledge and the adoption of SAP portfolios. First, we investigate the SAP portfolios that are jointly adopted using Correlation Explanation. Second, we estimate a multivariate probit model to explore if SAP portfolios are complementary or substitutionary to each other. Finally, we run a partial least squares structural equation model to investigate how the level of knowledge and informal knowledge are associated with the adoption of SAP portfolios. Results show that both the level of knowledge and informal knowledge are positively related to the adoption of these SAPs that require initial investments or aim to reduce pesticide and fertiliser usage. However, we find no significant relationship between knowledge and the adoption of SAPs that are already subsidised by policymakers. We conclude that persuading farmers to adopt more SAPs requires policymakers to consider combinations of economic (e.g. subsidies) and behavioural policy interventions (e.g. facilitating peer-to-peer knowledge sharing). © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Coastal areas are facing increasing heavy metal contamination from various human activities, posing a severe threat to aquatic and coastal biodiversity. Mangroves, abundant in coastal and marine ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable to the accumulation of toxic inorganic pollutants and heavy metals (HMs). Mangroves have proved to be effective in mitigating heavy metal pollution through a range of mechanisms, including avoidance, chelation, sequestration, tolerance, excretion, and filtration. Studies highlighted a higher metal bioconcentration of metals in mangrove roots compared to leaves, indicating their remarkable endurance capability towards high levels of HMs. The uptake of HMs by mangrove roots occurs through passive diffusion across cell plasma membranes or active transport, regulated by metal ion transporters and influenced by electrochemical and/or concentration potential gradients. In phytoremediation strategies, mangrove plants employ several physiochemical mechanisms to avoid HMs uptake, such as cell wall immobilization, complexation with biomolecules like phytochelatins (PCs), and extracellular barriers at the root endodermis. Moreover, mangroves can develop iron-plaques on their root surface, acting as reservoirs for immobilized HMs and significantly influencing their sequestration, particularly in wastewater containing Cr, Pb, and Ni ions. Mangroves would also trigger antioxidant defenses to cope with the absorbed HMs and normalize the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative stress. However, the antioxidant response in mangroves varies depending on the concentration and type of toxic HMs, plant species, and exposure duration. Additionally, mangroves excrete excessive amounts of HMs through salt glands via adaxial trichomes, allowing them to mitigate phytotoxicity. Although mangroves demonstrate a high tolerance capacity towards HMs, hydrological alteration, deforestation, marine construction, and marine anthropogenic activities pose significant threats to several global mangrove species. In conclusion, conducting multiple toxicity tests using early mangrove seedlings are imperative that threshold effect concentrations of various HMs be determined under natural environmental conditions encompassing nutrients, salinity, temperature, and the presence of several contaminants. Besides, long-term, large-scale mesocosm experiments in real-field settings should be conducted in future to obtain more realistic and reliable insights into the uptake and tolerance of HMs in mangroves. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Saussurea species, renowned for its biodiversity and medicinal significance in high-elevation regions, faces endangerment due to climate change and human activities. Despite this, conservation research on Saussurea has been limited. To fill the knowledge gap, this study employed the optimized MaxEnt model to simulate Saussurea's habitat suitability and analyze key environmental factors influencing its distribution. Additionally, considering the sensitivity of Saussurea habitats to climate change, this research also simulated the changes in suitable habitat and distribution centroid shifts of Saussurea under different climate scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585) for the periods 2040s, 2060s, 2080s and 2100s. Findings indicated that Saussurea's suitable habitat was primarily located in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, notably within the Himalayas and Hengduan Mountains. The areas of extremely and moderately suitable habitats were 1.106 × 10⁵ km2 and 3.436 × 10⁵ km2, respectively. Elevation, Isothermality (Bio3), and Temperature Annual Range (Bio7) were identified as the main environmental factors. Future projections suggest severe habitat fragmentation and a decrease in suitable habitat areas. By 2100, the total area of suitable Saussurea habitat will decrease under the SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585 scenarios to 8.658 × 10⁵ km2, 6.971 × 10⁵ km2, 5.811 × 10⁵ km2, and 5.979 × 10⁵ km2, respectively. Additionally, a slight southeastward shift in the distribution centroid was observed.

Thus, the improvement of urban resilience has emerged as an important issue in the context of global urbanization. However, a knowledge gap remains in its evaluation from the perspective of systematic resource/element metabolic processes. To understand the urban resilience response mechanism better and depict metabolic processes systematically, an urban resilience assessment framework of “robustness-adaptability-restorability-coordination” based on the cross-media carbon metabolism network model was established. Principles of material flow analysis and ecological network analysis were applied to examine the urban resilience of Guangzhou, China, from 2010 to 2020. Results showed the urban resilience level decreased from a carbon metabolism perspective during the study period. This was reflected in an overall decline in system robustness and restorability, relatively unchanged adaptability, and a non-beneficial coordination relationship. Recommendations such as regulating key sectors (e.g., agriculture and construction) were proposed to improve urban resilience. This research will bring a new insight into future urban resilience assessment and contribute the urban sustainable development. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

We derive and analyze a simple metric: the sum of the proportional changes in the global abundances of species caused by an organization, with a regularization to cover the case of species close to extinction. We argue mathematically that this metric quantifies changes in the mean long-term global survival probability of species. The metric thus supports the objective “to significantly reduce extinction risk” of the 2022 Global Biodiversity Framework and allows organizations to set themselves corresponding science-based targets. We show that in a perfect market trade in biodiversity credits quantified by our metric would lead to near-optimal allocation of resources to species conservation. We further show that metric values are quantitatively convertible to several other metrics and indices already in use. Barriers to adoption are therefore low. Used in conjunction with metrics addressing ecosystem services and integrity, potential areas of application include biodiversity related financial disclosures and voluntary or legislated biodiversity credit or no net loss policies. © 2024 The Author(s).

We develop Biomaris, a novel LCA-based way of accounting for multifunctionality of fisheries through the “fishnet approach” that includes various species in the fishnet and allocates impacts between co-products at landing. Biomaris adds two important LCIA pathways: resource depletion and seabed impact and uses the ecosystem quality endpoint of LC Impact. Impact pathways are grouped to display impacts for 4 drivers of biodiversity loss: direct exploitation, land and sea-use change, climate change, and pollution. It is applied to a business case study of a fishery of saithe (Pollachius virens) with bottom trawling. Case study at landing shows that impact on seabed is substantial (1×10−9PDF.year/kgliveweight), and that resource depletion and climate change are of similar order of magnitude (2×10−14PDF.year/kgliveweight), the pollution driver being less important.

As of now, despite drivers being expressed in the same unit (PDF.yr), aggregating them is not advised, as, depending on driver, unit concretely represent different level of species disappearance, either (eco)regional or global.

	abstract = {The coastal marine area hosts among the most productive ecosystems in the world, in terms of biomass and species richness. These ecosystems’ natural capital stocks provide essential flows of resources for the environment and human life. The distribution of natural capital (NC) and environmental flows (ENFL) characterizing the coastal marine habitats of Ligurian Sea, a biodiversity hotspot in the Mediterranean region, were assessed to define their current state. The study area was divided into 43 functional spatial sections, defined as “biomarine units”. In each biomarine unit natural capital and environmental flows were estimated using data on benthic and fish biomass. Emergy analysis, a thermodynamics-based methodology that expresses the costs in terms of resources incurred by nature to maintain the ecological processes of the marine coastal habitats, was then applied to assess the natural capital and the environmental flows in biophysical terms (solar emergy joules, sej), and using appropriate conversion factors, in monetary terms (emergy euro, em€). The monetary equivalents facilitate understanding for stakeholders and pave the way for the inclusion of marine resources value in socioeconomic and political contexts. The total value of natural capital for the Ligurian coastal and marine area is 2.11 billion em€, while for environmental flows, it is 1.43 billion em€ a−1. Greater values belong to units included within the boundaries of protected areas, proving the efficiency of the protection measures taken. These values represent a reference point and shall be kept constant to preserve natural capital and to ensure services provisioning at least at the current level. This work identify a method useful to monitor the status of natural capital value and environmental flows along Ligurian coast, which can be helpful to stakeholders and policymakers for better monitoring and management of the area. © 2023},

	abstract = {Important expectations are placed globally on the private sector to take part in co-governing sustainability challenges. With increasing recognition that business organizations depend and impact on natural capital, biodiversity, and related ecosystem services, it has become pivotal for companies to be able to appraise and manage such issues. This calls for developing avenues through which biodiversity and ecosystem services can be incorporated in sustainability accounting (as well as reporting and response practices) by individual organizations, without neglecting a value chain-wide perspective, and aligning that with existing efforts for public accounting of natural capital, against the overall framework of national and global sustainability goal and targets. This article addresses such a call by elaborating on the contributions of ecosystem services to business organizations and illustrating the two main challenges related to feeding private sector data into national accounting of natural capital and ecosystem services; and to understand how the two challenges identified in the previous point can be addressed by companies, we provide an overview of the fragmented landscape of management systems, approaches, methods, and initiatives dedicated to monitoring, reporting on, and responding to biodiversity and ecosystem services issues at the organizational and value chain level. We conclude by offering reflections on how to foster a shift from one-off assessments at the company level to more systematic and comprehensive ones along the value chain. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Global karst vegetation is crucial for carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. However, research on the carbon sink capacity of vegetation and its potential driving mechanisms across different geographic types of global karst remains scant. This research delineates the trend characteristics and differences of net primary productivity (NPP), heterotrophic respiration (Rh), and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) across various bedrock and climatic zones within global karst landscapes. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), Neural Network fitting, and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling were utilized to investigate the nonlinear impacts and underlying mechanisms exerted by the explanatory variables on NPP, Rh, and NEP. The findings indicate that from 1981 to 2019, the rates of increase in NPP (2.02 gC·m⁻2 yr⁻1), Rh (1.47 gC·m⁻2 yr⁻1), and NEP (0.54 gC·m⁻2 yr⁻1) were marginally higher in global karst regions compared to non-karst areas. Additionally, when contrasted with various bedrock types, the differences in mean values and trends of these three indicators were more pronounced across different climatic zones of karst areas. XGBoost effectively captures the nonlinear relationship between NEP and its explanatory variables, while SHAP provides a detailed explanation of the contribution and interaction of these variables. The leaf area index (LAI) was the major contributor to NEP. Additionally, the nonlinear effects of individual critical drivers on NEP varied across different aridity gradients. The cascade effect of explanatory variables on NEP follows a pathway where geography affects climate, climate change subsequently alters vegetation characteristics, and these changes in vegetation directly drive NPP and Rh, ultimately leading to an indirect impact on NEP. This impact pathway exhibits minimal difference across different bedrock and climate types. This study enhances our comprehension of the role of vegetation carbon sinks and their underlying mechanisms across various bedrock and climate types in global karst regions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Protected areas are crucial for safeguarding biodiversity and mitigating significant threats. However, the effectiveness of protected areas has been debated, particularly regarding their anthropogenic protection's impact on species migration within the current protected area network. To address this issue, we calculated the connectivity between landscape elements (e.g., Core, Patch, and Connector) in China based on the resistance theory, taking the Core with high habitat quality as a source. We found that the landscape connectivity of protected areas in China is 44% of that of the natural habitats (i.e., Core), indicating that the effectiveness of the connected network of protected areas in China requires improvement. Nevertheless, the planning of protected areas in the Yellow River Basin makes landscape connectivity higher than that of natural habitats. In addition, the species abundance in protected areas is lower than that of natural habitats, overall, species abundance increases with habitat quality and landscape connectivity. Our results indicate that the previously protected area planning mainly focused on mammals while overlooking reptiles but reducing landscape connectivity gaps can enhance species abundance. The findings underscore the importance of incorporating landscape connectivity into the effectiveness evaluation system of protected area networks. © 2024},

	abstract = {Reducing food waste could lower pressures on land resources and thereby contribute to the mitigation of global biodiversity loss. The reduction of food waste and biodiversity loss are also specified in the Sustainable Development Goals 12.3 and 15 of the United Nations. However, which supply chain stages and food products to target with policy measures is hardly known. Especially, a differentiation of the impact after sub-stages and taxa is still missing and is therefore quantified in the present study. The food waste mass at five supply chain stages and seven sub-stages in Germany was calculated and differentiated after 204 food products. All products were traced back to their countries of origin, in which their land use impact on mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and plants was quantified. A new approach was developed to calculate the detailed feed demand for animal products. Germany's avoidable food waste (food that was edible before its disposal) leads to 0.3 vertebrate and 1.5 plant species being potentially lost globally. Household-level waste is responsible for 47% of this species loss, while food services show the largest impact per mass, with individual catering being as influential as one-person households. The most influential products are obtained from pigs and cattle. Among vertebrate taxa, mainly amphibians are affected, occurring in the mainly affected country Brazil. The results can be used to formulate policies that target, for example, individual catering or display the impact of animal products and their feed demand. © 2024 The Authors.

However, fear of litigation arising from reporting potentially deters corporations to disclose such information. Motivated by the importance of biodiversity and mixed evidence of shareholder litigation rights as a corporate governance tool, we explore whether the universal demand laws (UDLs) have any effect on corporate biodiversity reporting in the United States. Supporting our short-termism, risk aversion and agency hypotheses, we find that an exogenous decline in the threat of derivative litigation, reducing a chance for shareholders to file a lawsuit against top management and intensifying agency costs, economically and significantly decreases a corporate's biodiversity reporting by 87%. When the disciplining effect of shareholder litigation drops, the self-interest manager may want to live a quiet life and disclose less information of biodiversity impact. A proactive business strategy to mitigate litigation and reputational risks is to voluntarily disclose more biodiversity-related information. Regulators around the world should also promote rigorous reporting requirements to reverse biodiversity loss and save our humanity. © 2024 The Author(s).

This shift aligns with the Ecological Conservation Redline (ECR) and integrates PAs into the National Territorial Spatial Planning, for a coordinated layout of Ecological-Productive-Living Spaces. The current study emphasizes the need for a refined assessment of PAs, including ecosystem services, to balance human development rights and environmental sustainability. It also advocates for multi-stakeholder consultation mechanisms to ensure broader social participation, particularly for indigenous peoples and local communities. The current investigation highlights the importance of valuing ecological products to harmonize environmental protection with community welfare.

However, the speed of restoration and the rapid recovery of biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem function remain a challenge. We present a novel approach for technical reclamation and rapid restoration using a 0.2 km2 extremely degraded tropical limestone post-mining site by using the initial forest soil that was removed by mining as the substrate, and by planting grown saplings of eight non-native fast-growing tree species. By comparing the belowground attributes in the restored site with that of undisturbed tropical forest and the mined unplanted soil, we deduced that our reforestation could recover soil N-cycling and P-cycling communities and associated soil N-cycling and P-cycling processes, root biomass, and key root functional traits to the levels found in forest soils within four years. The reforestation could also mitigate mining induced soil degradation such as soil alkalization, soil nutrient (organic matter, and N) deficiency and soil metal (cadmium, plumbum, copper, zinc, and mercury) pollution. Based on these findings, we recommend that using non-native fast growing tree species for planting with top-soil built using the initial soil can rapidly restore (<10 years) above-ground biomass, biogeochemical cycling soil microbial communities, and facilitate the recovery of native biodiversity. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {There is an increasing expectation on the private sector to address biodiversity impacts and contribute towards global conservation goals. Appropriate evidence use can help businesses avoid biodiversity losses and realise gains, reduce ineffective or suboptimal action, whilst minimising biodiversity-related risks and securing opportunities from engaging with biodiversity. We review the status of evidence-based action in the private sector, where previous studies have identified concerning trends, and explore the barriers that may currently be hindering practice. To learn from this, and improve the status quo, we propose a set of principles for evidence-based biodiversity impact mitigation. We outline tools and resources that can help businesses move towards evidence-based practice and achieve each of these principles. Meeting these principles would improve the biodiversity outcomes from businesses' biodiversity related actions. However, for business action to contribute more fully to global conservation goals, broader political and socio-economic issues also need addressing. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Adopting a theoretical framework from social narrative therapy, this paper examines how new realities are being constantly created as the corporate narrative is rewritten or ‘re-storied’ through engagement between NGO–therapists and corporate–clients. Detailed interviews are conducted with 21 NGOs operating in a developing economy and working with local and multi-national companies. The research reveals how the relationship between NGOs and companies has shifted from an adversarial one (reported in earlier studies) to one characterised by constructive dialogue, facilitation and mediation. The engagements have ‘therapeutic’ properties and offer one solution for tackling the impacts which modern business practices are having on biodiversity. An extensive review of narrative and social constructionist perspectives across business ethics, organisations and accounting is beyond the scope of this paper. The discussion and analysis are limited to the application of narrative approaches to counselling to NGO–company relationships. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Oil palm certification schemes such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) do not consider the full suite of biodiversity indicators, such as farmland birds that are commonly found in plantations. The sole focus of certification assessments is on rare, threatened, and endangered species, yet common farmland birds, which are not conservation priority species, are an essential component of healthy agro-ecosystems. This study is the first to identify potential indicator farmland bird species for assessing oil palm environmental sustainability irrespective of farming systems or practices. Sets of candidates of oil palm bird indicator species for four sub-regions in Southeast Asia; Peninsular Malaysia, Borneo, the Philippines, and Sumatera were developed based on information gathered from previously published studies. Then, point count and opportunistic bird surveys were conducted in Peninsular Malaysia to validate our indicator bird candidates obtained from the previous step. Our results show that oil palm agro-ecosystems were dominated by common farmland birds, and rarely supported any conservation priority species. All sub-regions indicator lists comprised only Least Concern (LC) bird species except for Peninsular Malaysia where Javan Myna was recorded as Vulnerable (VU). These bird species identified provide various ecosystem services (e.g., biological pest control and pollination) and are sensitive to habitat disturbances (e.g., replanting and pesticides). Thus, they should be designated as indicator species and a key component of oil palm certification criteria. Our study also found that indicator bird species are associated with geographical locations and endemism. Therefore, we suggest using regional bird biodiversity data for developing indicator species lists to improve the environmental sustainability of oil palm cultivation for specific regions. © 2023},

	abstract = {Along with habitat destruction and the intensification of climate change, economic and social development is threatening the living of species. In the context of China's domestic economic circulation, the spatial structure of biodiversity loss is complicated by the decentralization of production, with many regions affecting the survival of species in other regions. Based on the environmentally extended MRIO model, this paper calculated the subnational biodiversity loss footprint through structural path analysis and social network analysis, identified the regional linkages and spatial networks of species loss, and traced the conservation responsibility to specific sectors. Our findings indicate that Yunnan, Tibet, Guangdong, and Sichuan possess the most significant biodiversity footprints, comprising over 40% of the total footprint. In terms of threat patterns, Yunnan and Tibet have the largest intra-regional footprints, indicating their important impact on species within the region; Guangdong and Zhejiang have the largest extra-regional footprints, indicating their role in threatening other species through cross-regional trades. The primary industry, tap water and food and tobacco sectors are major biodiversity footprint producers. Overall, some eastern and coastal areas are the final drivers of biodiversity loss in China, driven by increasingly complex trade links. Notably, the directionality of species loss in biodiversity hotspots is evident, with Shandong and Guangdong significantly influencing the biodiversity of Yunnan and Guangxi, respectively. This study systematically analyzed the complete network of biodiversity loss and divided four biodiversity protection communities to promote the realization of trans-regional protection and compensation. Examining the biodiversity loss through the lens of networks, and connecting economic activities to species, serves as a warning to decision-making bodies that a future of increasingly intricate domestic trade could pose a critical threat to biodiversity, necessitating collaborative conservation efforts. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The inappropriate spatio-temporal distribution of natural capital during rapid urbanization has increased ecosystem service supply-demand (ESSD) risks, posing great challenges to the sustainable growth of human well-being, especially in urban agglomerations. Although methods focusing on the spatial match or temporal dynamics of ESSD in risk assessment have been established, a comprehensive understanding of the spatial dynamics underlying ecosystem service flows (ESF) is still missing. Due to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of various ESSD risks within urban agglomerations, incorporating these elements into a unified spatial planning framework is still difficult. This study integrated the spatio-temporal analysis method of ESSD considering ESF and the spatial clustering method to propose an ESSD risk assessment and management framework: evaluating ES supply, demand and flow, incorporating ESF to quantify ESSD across various timeframes, assessing ESSD risks based on the current status and dynamic trends, and using Self-Organizing Map to identify optimal ESSD risk bundles (ESSDR_Bs). The results showed high ESSD risks of high temperature regulation, nitrogen purification, phosphorus purification, and food production in Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration. While the ESSD risks of biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, soil retention, water yield, and tourism culture were relatively low, a concerning trend of decreasing surpluses was observed in general. In addition, six ESSDR_Bs were identified, and differentiated ecological management strategies were proposed for each bundle. This study provided a novel perspective for efficiently understanding and regulating the ESSD risks in urban agglomerations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {“Green energy” is the energy that can be produced while sustaining ecosystem services. Maintenance of the services provided by the ecosystem requires energy, termed the ecosystem maintenance energy (ESME). Including ESME costs in energy accounting enables assessment of an energy plant's ability to produce energy over and above inputs and EMSE costs over the lifetime of the plant. In this work, an assessment of the potential of two renewable energy plants wind and solar photovoltaic to produce “green energy” is undertaken, those were chosen due to their likely dominance of the future energy market. The assessment is done using a methodology that unifies environmental impact assessment, ESME and energy accounting into a single metric termed the green energy return on investment (EROIg). The paper also extends ESME calculation by incorporating ecosystem impacts that were previously unaccounted-for such as: biodiversity loss; delayed ecosystem maintenance; carbon capture by photosynthesis; ozone depletion and formation and ionizing radiation. The solar and wind energy plants considered were sized to produce an equivalent amount of annual energy and were placed at a theoretical location where the capacity factor (CF) is equivalent to the average global utility scale CF for each resource. The study found that onshore wind energy has a greater potential in generating green energy with an EROIg of 17.19. Removal of impacts related to biodiversity loss, which is included here for the first time, is found to play a critical role in plant assessment from both biodiversity and CO2 capture by photosynthesis perspective. Plants needing and providing biodiversity offsets are shown to provide an overall 18%–25% improvement in EROIg. This improvement is triggered by the corresponding CO2 capture by photosynthesis. Some design options were evaluated to determine the sensitivity of the resulting EROIg to the plant design and to the temporal element of the investigation. Those include the addition of battery storage and the delay in action on ecosystem maintenance from a 20-year to a 100-year time horizon which were found to reduce the resultant EROIg by >40% and >87% respectively. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {The Pan-Himalayan biogeographic domain is a significant region for biodiversity conservation and climate resilience. This region has both tropical and extratropical flora and holds ecological, cultural, and socio-economic importance. However, knowledge about the spatial distribution and threats to threatened plant species in the study area is still poorly known. In this study we evaluate the phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic endemism of threatened flora in the region, and also examine the effect of rapid land cover transformation and landscape fragmentation between 2000 and 2020 on the preservation of distinct evolutionary lineages. Phylogenetic metrics provide a better understanding of ecological, historical, and evolutionary factors that shape plant communities in highly biodiverse regions. Our result show that current protected areas are insufficient for preserving Pan-Himalayan biodiversity, and also reveal a significant gap in conservation efforts within these areas. We highlight conservation priorities areas in the western Himalayan belt encompassing 2.43 million km2 and covering 26.73% of the total area. However, a large conservation gap encompassed 22.67% (2.06 million km2) hotspots of total study area, whereas non-hotspot priorities covered 67.62% (0.77 million km2) of the total protected area, revealing a mismatch between biodiversity hotspots and protected areas. In addition, biodiversity priority areas have been threatened by rapid land cover transformation and landscape fragmentation between 2000 and 2020. There were 6.93% increase in cropland area and 172.64% increase in impervious surface, while an increase in landscape fragmentation and a decrease in landscape cohesion in different hotspots within protected areas. The biodiversity hotspot regions emphasize the need to conserve unique evolutionary lineages and high species occurrence areas with targeted conservation strategies. Mountainous, but cross-border international cooperation is highly recommended for effective preservation strategies. Our study has implications for advancing biodiversity preservation and sustainable ecosystem management not only in the Pan-Himalayan but also in similar regions, as well as for achieving the 2030 protection goal. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Graph theory (GT) has become an indispensable tool for exploring environmental interconnections and elucidating ecological relationships. The integration of GT with Ecological network analysis (ENA) has been increasingly recognised for its potential to enhance our understanding of ecological systems. However, the application of GT in ENA faces several limitations that warrant closer examination. This paper aims to investigate these challenges through a systematic review, adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The review encompasses 329 selected articles published from January 2014 to December 2021, highlighting GT's uptake in ENA but also pinpointing significant challenges. The review reveals that while GT offers flexibility in analysing different ecological networks (ENs), challenges exist related to understanding landscape dynamics, the accuracy of measurement scale, species-specific data, and reliability. Specially, the use of nodes and links presents definitional and measurement complexities, compounded by an overwhelming variety of indicators that may dilute analytical precision. The paper advocates for the development of frameworks to conceptualise ideal and sustainable ENs and to establish indicators for assessing network efficacy. Future research must tackle these methodological hurdles, with a special focus on refining measurement scale, species-specific data, spatio-temporal considerations, and node and link assessment for different species, while ensuring reliability. Additionally, the potential of GT to mitigate the impact of ecological threats is underscored as a critical area for future applications. Addressing these challenges is imperative for advancing GT's contribution to ENA and fostering more effective environmental conservation strategies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Balancing intensive development with biodiversity conservation is critical for ecological sustainability. In the Loess Hilly-Gully region, which has experienced significant environmental changes from 1980 to 2020, land use changes are vital for ecosystem service maintenance. However, these processes are susceptible to environmental stressors such as climate change, land degradation, and inadequate land management. Despite recognizing these stressors, their combined impact on land use and ecosystem services is not well understood. This study addresses this gap by utilizing multi-model land use simulations combined with artificial intelligence to analyze changes over the four-decade period. We focused on identifying ecological nodes essential for landscape connectivity, finding that these nodes significantly enhance regional ecosystem services. We also examined the relationship between land use changes and ecosystem services under various environmental stressors within the specified timeframe. Our analysis indicates that land use changes are a strong indicator of ecosystem evolution in these areas. We observed that under natural conditions, land use and ecosystem services interactions are governed by both stochastic and deterministic factors. Interestingly, multiple stressors intensified the stochastic nature of land use changes and the deterministic aspects of ecosystem services. Specifically, climate change, coupled with suboptimal land management, significantly affects this relationship, with climate change being the most influential factor on land use patterns during the studied period. This research offers important insights for improved environmental management and reducing impacts on aquatic ecosystems amid escalating climate change threats. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The high demand for tuna, coupled with unsustainable supply chain practices, has triggered illegal fishing, overfishing, and environmental damage, including bycatch, pollution, and climate change impacts. To address these issues, the world urgently needs sustainable alternatives to meet tuna demand while preserving our oceans, marine species, and the environment. In this paper, a sustainable three-layer tuna fish supply chain model consisting of a single farmer, processor, and retailer is developed for two different quality levels of tuna fish. Green technology and integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) methods are implemented at the farmer stage to reduce emissions and ocean pollution. Fish waste utilization technology, seaweed bioplastic packaging technology, and green technologies are implemented at the processor stage to reduce fish waste, plastic pollution, and carbon emissions. Blockchain technology is implemented for the traceability and transparency of the whole supply chain in order to avoid illegal and unsustainable tuna fish entering the market. The optimal solutions of the average integrated total profit are found by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm in Python platform. The farmer's and processor's emission costs are reduced by 80% by investing in green technology. The transportation cost is also reduced. The fish waste utilization and plastic waste minimization costs of processors are reduced by more than 95% by investing in fish waste utilization and seaweed bioplastic packaging technology. The concavity of the average integrated total profit function is shown in a 3D graph. The optimal solution, sensitivity analysis, numerical examples, and managerial implications are presented for the tuna fish supply industries. The proposed model is applicable to any food processing industry. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

With increasing awareness of the impact of sustainable board governance on corporate environmental performance, our paper includes an innovative sustainable board governance score, reflecting significant board attributes. The question arises whether the combined effect of sustainable board measures, based on (1) sustainability board committees, (2) a critical mass of female board members, and (3) sustainability-related executive compensation, influences environmental performance and its main sub-pillars according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Based on stakeholder and critical mass theories, our study empirically addresses the impact of sustainable board governance on environmental performance and five sub-pillars (carbon, emissions, biodiversity, resource use, and water performance). Using a sample of 2630 firm-year observations from 2014 to 21, we find that sustainable board governance significantly improves environmental performance and the related sub-pillars, except for biodiversity and water performance. Our findings are robust to robustness analyses and endogeneity checks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to rely on the combined effect of sustainable board attributes and its impact of environmental performance and its major sub-pillars. Thus, this study provides new insight into the relationship between corporate governance and environmental performance in the EU capital market to guide researchers, business practice, and regulatory bodies. © 2023 The Author.

Studying the impact of human activities expansion on natural habitats globally and in various biomes can provide scientific reference for differentiated approaches to global habitat restoration. However, previous studies still lack identification of the impact of global human activities expansion on natural habitats, especially in different biomes. Here we used the InVEST model to assess the changes in habitat quality globally and across biomes over the past 20 years and analyzed the impact of human activities expansion on them using Spearman correlation coefficients. The results showed an overall global degradation of natural habitats of 0.537% during 2000–2020, while human activities increased by 10.990%. Mangroves were the biomes with the most severe habitat degradation, while deserts and xeric shrublands were the biomes with the most significant habitat restoration. At the global scale, human activities had caused significant and growing negative impact on natural habitats, while in terms of different biomes, human activities may bring about habitat restoration. The findings of this study recommend the implementation of differentiated human activities regulation measures in different biomes to promote global habitat restoration. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

To that end, we first dispel a common misperception among business scholars that biodiversity loss is caused by only a few industries, clarifying that it is driven by practically all. Further, we organize corporate biodiversity protection strategies into four categories based on temporal and spatial dimensions, namely, conservation, restoration, compensation, and reparation. Finally, we illustrate the unsettled nature of the field and the continuing debates among conservation biologists about the best approaches to biodiversity management. We argue that (i) a firm's biodiversity protection strategy should aim to mitigate the primary driver through which the firm causes biodiversity loss; (ii) firms should report performance in each of the four biodiversity protection strategies separately; and (iii) interdisciplinary collaborations among corporate sustainability scholars and conservation biologists are critical to developing effective biodiversity protection strategies. © 2022 The Authors.

The Social Progress Index (SPI), also known as social development, contains all these features. This study aims to examine the impact of natural resource extraction on social development quadratically using data from 2011 to 2022. The focus of the study is on resource-rich countries. In this study, productive capacity in the energy sector is used as a social development determinant and a natural resource consumption moderator, ensuring sustainability in social development. Analyzing the quadratic relationship allows us to model and understand nonlinear relationships between the predictor and the outcome variable, capturing the effects that change direction or strength at different levels of the predictor. In this study, Bayesian regression is incorporated as an econometric approach. It provides more flexible modelling, incorporates prior knowledge, and offers a full distribution of parameter estimates, leading to better uncertainty quantification and more robust predictions. These estimates confirms a U-shaped natural resource extraction and social development relationship. Energy productive capacities in resource-rich countries not only enhance social development but also ensure the sustainable extraction of natural resources leading to sustainable social development. Population density and biodiversity are incorporated as control variables of the model. The impact of both is positive on social development. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Demand is increasing among investors to create portfolios that encourage positive outcomes for biological diversity. The evolution of investment strategies for transitions to zero carbon over the last two decades provides insights that will assist in shaping strategies for biodiversity-positive investments. Many emerging approaches to capture company impact and dependence on biodiversity focus on nature-related threats to an organisation by assessing ecosystem integrity. Other approaches focus on minimising an organisation's contribution to risks of species extinction by using data sets such as the IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species. However, while these approaches are useful for assessing threats to and from biodiversity for individual companies, to be effective for investment portfolio construction, metrics need to be comparable across companies in an investment universe. Many of the threat assessments that could link corporate activities to impacts are incomplete and omit critical information. If the investment community focuses on biodiversity without sufficient forethought, there is a risk of entrenching metrics with significant flaws. In this paper, we suggest that interim approaches are needed to support investors in understanding the approaches being taken by potential investee companies. To that end, we present and discuss a disclosure-based Biodiversity Management Quality and a classification-based Biodiversity Revenues metric for biodiversity-related investing. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {The Ramsar Convention places central emphasis on the protection, restoration, and utilization of wetlands. Wetland species and their habitat protection is an important embodiment of wetland system protection. Simultaneously, the importance of recreation as a form of human activity within wetlands should not be underestimated. Wetland parks, as a mode of rational wetland use, provide the public opportunities for leisure and entertainment, exemplifying China's commitment to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. However, With the acceleration of urbanization, the degree of fragmentation of the wetland system is increasing. The wetland park and its surrounding landscape elements are separated from each other, resulting in the phenomenon of islanding, which is not conducive to the protection and utilization of wetland biodiversity. This study focuses on Yancheng coastal wetland, a UNESCO World Heritage site in Jiangsu, China, as its research area. It integrates habitat birds, a core component of wetland biodiversity, into the development framework of wetland parks. The study proposes the use of composite habitat corridors to connect fragmented bird habitats with public recreational areas, establishing a collaborative wetland park system. The methodology involved three key steps: (1)Spatial Modeling. Utilizing Maxent, the spatial distribution of birds and public recreation areas was modeled, and suitable patches for both were extracted. (2) Corridor Identification. Linkage Mapper was employed to identify bird and recreational corridors, while the MCR model was used to pinpoint composite habitat corridors. (3) Network Development. Corridors generated in the previous step were superimposed on the ArcGIS platform to create a network of interconnected bird habitats and public recreation areas within the wetland park system. The study's results demonstrate: (1) There are obvious spatial distribution differences between the current core bird habitat and public recreation areas in Yancheng coastal wetland. (2) The establishment of a composite corridor network realizes the interconnection between bird habitats and public recreation areas，among them, the corridor network in the southern region is short and dense, with higher stability. (3) The areas passed by the composite corridor network are mainly productive landscapes such as cultivated land and aquaculture ponds, and therefore, certain protection and restoration measures should be taken to create suitable habitat conditions for birds and humans. This study provides a novel model for wetland protection and sustainable utilization, particularly relevant to many developing countries facing similar challenges. © 2023},

Existing research indicates that value orientation impacts propensity for pro-environmental behaviours. However, as biodiversity loss remains inadequately addressed, this study employs the value-belief-norm framework to explore how leaders with strong biospheric and altruistic (collectively termed ‘bigger-than-self’) value orientations perceive their responsibility for biodiversity loss in comparison with climate change and, using an adaptation of the Global Reporting Initiative standards, how biodiversity is prioritised against other areas of environmental sustainability in their businesses. Surveying 61 SME leaders, primarily in the South-West UK, it was found that biodiversity is often considered of low priority compared with factors such as energy, waste, materials and emissions. Analysis also indicates that these leaders feel less responsibility for biodiversity than for climate change demonstrating that, even where bigger-than-self values dominate, there is a need for higher prioritisation of biodiversity amongst SMEs. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Land use activities play an essential role in habitat degradation and restoration. As priority zones for global habitat conservation, studying the impact of land use activities on habitat quality (HQ) in the World Protected Areas (WDPA) has great importance. However, insights into land use activities and HQ in the WDPA remain scarce and their relationship is still unclear. Here, we assessed land use activities and HQ in the WDPA over the past 20 years and analyzed the impact of land use activities on HQ. The results showed that forestland was the dominant land use type in the WDPA and that the area of forestland, bare land, and water area decreased while the area of other land use types increased during the study period. Land use change in protected areas in different continents shows great differences. Land use intensity (LUI) in the WDPA increased over the 20 years, but HQ remained largely unchanged. LUI increased but HQ decreased was the main change type of grid cells in the WDPA. The bivariate spatial autocorrelation results showed that High-Low (high HQ and low LUI) clusters were the dominant clustering type in the WDPA, while Low-High (low HQ and high LUI) clusters were the least represented clustering type. The regression results showed that LUI tended to have a negative effect on HQ in forested areas and a positive effect on HQ in desert, permafrost areas. These findings can provide a reference for effective land use differentiation control measures and biodiversity conservation measures in the WDPA. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Understanding synchronous vegetation changes are crucial to assess the impact of carbon cycle on climate warming in peatlands. We established a mesocosm system to monitor ecosystem respiration (Re) and methane (CH4) fluxes in the growing season from 2020 to 2021 under different scenarios, including warming and manipulations of species diversity. Overall, the mean Re and CH4 fluxes varied in the ranges of 1.38 ± 0.18 to 46.25 ± 6.62 mg CO2–C m−2 h−1 and 2.72 ± 2.36 to 319.55 ± 96.22 μg CH4–C m−2 h−1, respectively, with the highest values appearing in the middle of growing season. The Re and CH4 fluxes in L-III and L-IV mesocosms showed significant increases of 38.86% and 54.28%, and 56.38% and 107.54%, respectively, compared to the monoculture treatment. The primary controls for this phenomenon were the plant biomass and the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and phenolics. Warming significantly increased the emissions of CO2 by ∼40% during the study period, but it reduced the fluxes of CH4 in 2021. Sustained warming and soil water loss may destroy the original anaerobic environment, which plays a role in inhibiting the generation and emission of CH4 in the long term. Interestingly, although warming has reduced CH4 emissions, a mixture of three and four species seems to buffer more than 50% of this impact, further demonstrating the positive contribution of species diversity. Our results indicate that an increase in species diversity, specifically manifested in the expansion of vascular plants as a community process adapting to warming, can strongly affect carbon fluxes in peatlands and create potential feedback on future climate environments. © 2023},

	abstract = {Ecological conservation redline (ECRL) is a rigorously defined regulatory boundary established within critical zones, including ecological functional areas, ecologically sensitive regions, and vulnerable areas. It serves as the foundational threshold for preserving the ecological security of both national and regional contexts. Flood detention areas constitute a pivotal facet within the realm of ecological functionality. The delineation of ECRL boundaries for these flood detention areas aims to optimize the ecological structural composition, augmenting their capacity to provide ecosystem services. This endeavor holds profound implications of practical significance. However, there is currently a lack of methods for delineating ECRLs in flood detention areas. To address the above problem, taking Anxiang County in the Yangtze River Basin of China as an example, this study establishes a regional flood regulation service evaluation method through in-depth investigation and analysis of the ecosystem in the area. The method considers the importance of the evaluation of five ecosystem services, including flood regulation, water conservation, soil conservation, biodiversity conservation, and carbon sequestration. Based on these evaluations, the ECRL for Anxiang County is ultimately determined, with the area of 198.62 km2, accounting for 18.12% of the total area. Additionally, from the perspective of ecosystem service spatial transfer, a quantitative study is conducted on the ecosystem service radiation effect of the ECRL in Anxiang County, estimated to be approximately 1,462 million CNY. Overall, this study provides a theoretical basis for delineating ECRL in flood detention areas and developing corresponding ecological compensation systems for the watershed. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {To reconcile environmental issues with socioeconomic development, the mitigation hierarchy emerges as a pivotal strategy that sequentially addresses environmental impacts through a structured approach of avoidance, minimization, remediation, and offsetting. No net loss (NNL) is achieved when biodiversity gains from all four mitigation stages are larger than the project's environmental impacts. Here, we assessed biodiversity changes linked to the implementation of the S11D Eliezer Batista iron mining Complex in the Carajás National Forest, Pará state, Brazil, expecting losses due to mining activities and gains through forest restoration offsets. We evaluated biodiversity stocks based on Biotic Value as the product of habitat importance and actual conditions. Habitat importance, a unique value for each class of land cover recognized within the study site, is based on the evaluation of habitat naturalness, rarity and endangerment, and substitutability. Actual conditions are computed from field-surveyed key ecological attributes of vegetation structure, community composition and diversity, and ecological processes, and forest restoration activities are able to restitute, within 4–6 years only, approximately 73 % of old-growth forest conditions. The Biotic Value ranges from 0 for mine lands to 1 for patchy savanna formations stocking above ironstone outcrops (locally known as cangas) and amounts to 0.43 units/ha for secondary forests. Between 2008 and 2021, we detected comprehensive land-use changes in the study area: Cangas, farmlands and old-growth forests decreased, while secondary forests and minelands increased considerably. Despite environmental degradation, the emergence of secondary forests contributed to a positive biodiversity balance within the areas managed by the mining company (+379 units), while biodiversity losses dominated outside the company's boundaries (−171 units). Although like-for-like compensation of canga impacts remains challenging, we thus conclude that forest restoration efforts initiated by the mining company effectively reversed the trajectory of environmental degradation prevailing in the landscape and provided considerable biodiversity gains for the region. © 2024 The Authors},

However, their responses to these institutional pressures remain largely unexplored, particularly in sectors such as tea. This study aims to identify the institutional factors influencing corporate biodiversity management in Sri Lankan tea plantation companies and how such influences are translated into organizational practices. The data gathered using multiple sources, including interviews, field visits and document analysis, were analysed using institutional theory. The study reveals that regulatory influence and certification standards have significantly shaped biodiversity management practices, leading to structural- and field-level changes within tea plantation companies. The tea companies' conservation initiatives have been institutionalized with homogeneous characteristics at the managerial level. However, in the actual practice, institutional pressures have been translated into many heterogeneous practices at the field-level due to the numerous ways in which ideas disembed, travel and reembed across different organizational levels and are implemented by operational staff in a variety of ways. © 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {The rising demand for critical metals presents a major economic opportunity for mineral-rich countries. For a sustainable transition to a low-carbon future, it is essential to minimise impacts of mineral resource development to the environment, ecosystems, and societies of these nations. Although there has been considerable progress in the social aspects of the mining sector, environmental metrics are not showing comparable improvement. The Philippines exemplifies this challenge as a country that aims to conserve its exceptional biodiversity to maximise ecosystem services while expanding mining activities for economic growth, in a geographical setting with high mineral potential and vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change. Similar to many mining areas, environmental baselines are mostly non-existent, compounded by a legacy of mining impacts despite an established policy framework. We review issues associated with large- and small-scale mining and identify underlying research challenges and opportunities in the Philippines. Potential environmental research pathways include (i) innovative approaches for catchment scale characterisation and identification of contaminant sources; (ii) quantifying and predicting contaminant transport; (iii) deployment of flexible monitoring devices for larger-scale water quality monitoring programmes; (iv) tailings dam monitoring and management; and (v) resource assessment and metal recovery in ores and tailings. By integrating geomorphological tools with geochemical data, as well as 2D/3D numerical modelling techniques, it becomes possible to predict and understand the behaviour and fate of contaminants across different spatial and temporal scales. The development of cost-effective water quality assessment devices and protocols can help overcome logistical challenges in monitoring a wider range of hydrological conditions. Advanced applications of remote sensing, combined with machine learning, and geophysical monitoring systems provide new opportunities to detect mining footprints and observe change in tailings dams more effectively. Potential impacts of mine wastes can be further minimised by exploring innovative technologies such as the use of metal-accumulating native plant species and environmentally safe solvents to reprocess modern and legacy tailings. Insights from these pathways will enable the realisation of a more sustainable mining future, through the incorporation of findings into existing and future governmental and small- and large-scale mining policy and practice. This will lead to sustainable development for society, particularly in nations that are well positioned to benefit from sustainable mineral resource development. © 2024},

	abstract = {Landscape changes driven by anthropogenic activities often have negative impacts on ecosystems, jeopardizing the provision of vital services that sustain biotic elements and wildlife. Predicting the effects of such transformations is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate ecological damage. This study explores the interaction of land use changes and habitat quality estimates in the Upper Paraguay River Basin in Brazil, using the InVEST Habitat Quality model to estimate spatiotemporal landscape trends and evaluate the potential impact of land use policies for the future. Under a business-as-usual scenario by 2050, potential land use changes are simulated for shaping habitat quality, habitat degradation, and habitat rarity estimates as landscape proxies for biodiversity conservation. Results show an extensive expansion of pastures through deforestation, leading to progressive habitat degradation with a significant decay in the predicted and observed habitat quality. The habitat quality index estimates show a spatial decrease from 0.78 to 0.57 for the 1989–2050 period. The same trend is observed in protected areas for the period 2019–2050, with an increase of anthropogenic land use and a decrease of the habitat quality from 0.80 to 0.57 in conservation units, and from 0.75 to 0.53 in indigenous lands. For improved conservation outcomes, this work introduces new insights for shaping environmental actions that can be flagged as sustainable land management practices and ecological perspectives towards spatial pressures at different scales. Therefore, government institutions responsible for the protection of conservation units and indigenous communities can be informed about potential land use impacts on their territories. The findings suggest that incorporating additional scenario trends and climate-related variables could be a valuable direction for future studies to extend further the modelling approaches explored in this work. © 2024 The Authors},

Addressing this evolution, this manuscript has applied an innovative methodology to calculate a WEF nexus index (WEFni). This index seamlessly integrates both environmental and nutritional profiles across diverse case studies involving fisheries, aquaculture, and processing production systems in the European Atlantic area. The results showed that when it comes to fishing, purse seine fishing obtained the highest score (99%). For the aquaculture activities, seafood (>73%) obtained better results than fish farming. About processing treatments, freezing (>79%) has lower environmental loads than canning. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was carried out according to a caloric- and edible-based functional unit as well as the modification of the weighting factors assigned to each footprint, in which important variations were reported in the WEFni of most case studies. Consequently, although the methodological guidelines supporting the WEFni have great potential to serve as an ecolabeling tool, certain aspects need to be re-evaluated. On the other hand, it could be interesting to include the potential biodiversity loss, as well as other socioeconomic indicators, with the purpose of considering a more sustainability criteria. Finally, the contribution of this paper to the food industry literature is of paramount importance, as it represents a first step towards holistic assessments and easy-to-understand ecolabelling processes that can promote sustainable production and consumption. © 2024},

	abstract = {Future projections indicate an expansion for both food and energy demands, which can increase pressure on land use, while there is an urgent global need for climate change mitigation. Bioenergy is foreseen as key option to meet future energy demands and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, however its sustainability depends on locations and regional characteristics. Simultaneously, agricultural production models that co-produce food, feed, and energy offer sustainability synergies and co-benefits, but site-specific sustainability assessments of their large-scale implementation are missing. This study presents a bottom-up approach to assess spatially explicit sustainability aspects of bioenergy-livestock integrated systems (BLI) in Brazil and shed light on their contribution to future energy demands, to climate change mitigation targets, and their impacts on selected ecosystem services, including bioenergy production, climate change mitigation, reduction of food competition, biodiversity conservation, and avoided deforestation. The proposed integration considers livestock intensification and use of biofuels by-products as animal feed supplement, taking advantage of synergies between these two value chains. The expansion of the BLI system in the Center-South region of Brazil produce up to 89 billion liters of ethanol, enough to meet future domestic ethanol demands from multiple shared socioeconomic pathways and generating surpluses for export. This production takes place on 16 million hectares of pastureland within the Sugarcane Agroecological Zoning, excluding the Amazon and Pantanal biomes, and biodiversity hotspots. BLI expansion mitigate up to 250 million tonnes of CO2eq and generate 15 billion dollars of profits. The best locations to maximize the selected ecosystem services are west of São Paulo, east of Mato Grosso do Sul, and the south-central region of the states of Goiás. This study may encourage the formulation of enhanced public policies for the integration of bioenergy and livestock value chains and guide a sustainable large-scale deployment of BLI systems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study delves into the socio-ecological system (SES) of tribal home-gardens within India's Similipal Biosphere Reserve (SBR), unveiling their vital role in fostering biodiversity, resilience, and sustainability. Grounded in an SES framework, our research elucidates the deep interconnectivity between tribal communities and their home-gardens, woven into the tapestry of broader environmental and social dynamics. These gardens, rich in crops, forest species, and livestock, serve as dynamic reservoirs of indigenous and local knowledge (ILK), crucial for bolstering local economies and enhancing climate resilience. We analysed 36 focus group discussions across 36 villages and identified 15 indigenous nature-based practices that significantly contribute to 9 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 22 Sustainable Development Targets (SDTs). Indigenous home-gardening practices underpin climate change adaptation strategies and highlight the importance of integrating biodiversity and socio-economic objectives. Our findings underscore the criticality of diversification in enhancing resilience within indigenous SES, showcasing the balance between human adaptability and ecological symbiosis. The tribal home-gardens, driven by indigenous stewardship, provide essential ecosystem services and are instrumental in ecosystem protection, conservation, and restoration. Additionally, they play a pivotal role in enabling climate change adaptation, fostering gender empowerment, and upholding cultural significance, all sustained by dynamic feedback loops with their natural environment. This paper advocates for the greater recognition and integration of such indigenous-led NbS and ILK in global climate initiatives, emphasising their indispensability in enhancing climate resilience and promoting sustainable development within similar SES. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

We posit that robust corporate biodiversity efforts mitigate the suppression of negative information, consequently reducing the risk of abrupt stock price declines. Leveraging a global dataset and innovative biodiversity management metrics from Moody's ESG Solutions (former Vigero Eiris), our multivariate regression analysis demonstrates that companies with stronger biodiversity structures and actions exhibit lower stock price crash risk. In an additional analysis, we focus on environmental inspections as a possible conduit for releasing negative information on biodiversity management. Using a subsample of North American firms that were inspected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we find that firms which experience an inspection record an increase in their stock price crash risk. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {Biodiversity loss is one of the planetary boundaries that is most urgently in need of action. However, very little is known about the consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for products with higher (or lower) levels of biodiversity performance. Therefore, this research was conducted to investigate how consumers’ WTP is influenced by a product's impact on biodiversity. To address this question, we collected representative data from 524 German consumers in a survey-based experiment. Drawing on prospect theory, we identified the shape of the WTP reaction function for a given product in relation to its biodiversity performance. We demonstrate that consumers with sufficiently high levels of education and concern about biodiversity loss are willing to pay more for products with above-average biodiversity performance and less for products with below-average biodiversity performance. However, the extent to which a product outperforms the industry average does not influence consumers’ increased WTP. From a sustainable development perspective, these observed patterns highlight the problematic contrast between the pressing need for substantial improvements in product biodiversity performance and the limited incentives provided by consumers. Consequently, the findings suggest that the incentives that consumers currently provide for corporate biodiversity management are insufficient to assist in staying within the planetary boundaries. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The land has been a source of capital accumulation since colonization through extractive activities like mining and industrial agriculture. Indigenous peoples have profoundly different relationships with the land, which are more relational than extractive. However, their knowledge has been subjugated by and systematically excluded from Western conservation policies, which are based on colonial modes of control. We begin to address this issue by elaborating on a community-based participatory project, namely a Conservation Impact Bond (CIB), developed in Canada with Deshkan Ziibiing. This CIB was unique since it combined Indigenous and Western knowledges and aimed at restoring ecosystems by building relationships of kinship between peoples and the land. Based on our findings, we propose a Two-Eyed Seeing relationship-building process model – a multi-stakeholder initiative (MSI) incorporating Indigenous and Western knowledges. We discuss the implications of our findings for mobilizing capital to serve collective rather than private interests while promoting Indigenous resurgence and land regeneration. We suggest shifting from extractive to regenerative capital is necessary to address the climate and biodiversity loss crises. This transformation could be achieved by embracing a relational ontology through Two-Eyed Seeing. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Nowadays, ecosystem damages limit sustainable development, which is exacerbated by the scarcity and high demand for resources such as water, energy and food. Therefore, this paper presents a new integrated circular economy approach to optimize the generation, use, and distribution of resources in a given region that takes into account the environmental footprint while considering the net social benefit. Multiple objectives, such as nexus security and environmental damage, are prioritized in terms of three categories: human health, ecosystem quality and resource depletion. The optimization model includes the life cycle analysis for each technology or extraction source with the eco-indicator 99 methodology throughout the supply chain. The determinant variables identified were water availability, renewable energy production and local food production. The food sector is described as promoting the use of hydroponic technologies, animal carrying capacity, and aquaculture activities. An area of Mexico was considered as a case study, considering domestic, industrial, and agricultural activities. The analysis of the variables of interest was carried out using different groups, identifying 7 attractive optimal scenarios. A direct proportion is observed between the security of the water-energy-food nexus and the associated economic profits, while the life cycle assessment fluctuates with the use of services. The results show the satisfaction of the demand for water, energy, and food, highlighting the vulnerability of the food sector concerning the net objectives by including unconventional techniques to provide healthy diets. Food accounts for 76–94% of the total damage caused, where each type of food is analyzed according to the excess energy needed to obtain in the future, the change in biodiversity, and the disability-adjusted life years, having as a reference the main diseases that cause death in Mexico. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The emerging field of prospective life cycle assessment (pLCA) offers opportunities for evaluating the environmental impacts of possible future consumption shifts. One such shift involves a transition from meat-based to plant-forward diets, acknowledged to mitigate environmental impacts of the food system under present day conditions. Current diets are often meat intensive (“meat-based”), whilst “plant-forward” diets include mainly plant-based foods, encompassing flexitarian, vegetarian, and vegan diets. Here we illustrate the application of pLCA in a case study of meal options, implementing shared socio-economic pathway scenarios in the LCA background system to represent future production conditions. We assess the climate footprints and land-based biodiversity footprints of a typical meat-based meal in Germany and Indonesia compared to a plant-forward meal in both countries (i.e., four meals), now and in 2050. Our findings show that the plant-forward alternative maintains a lower impact per serving in all future scenarios. At the same time, the reduction in impact for the meat-based meals is more pronounced in future scenarios due to shifts in the agricultural system. Our findings highlight the importance of supply-side measures to produce lower-impact ingredients, complementing demand-side interventions to reshape food consumption. Results are further evaluated in cultural and nutritional contexts, highlighting the practical decision-making constraints faced by consumers. We find potential “leakage” effects in calories and nutrition when choosing a lower-impact, plant-forward meal. These leakage effects should be considered in future studies seeking to evaluate the environmental implications of meal substitutions in the context of broader dietary requirements. © 2024 The Author(s).

This study investigates the relationship between sand mining, land-use change, economic growth, environmental policy stringency, urbanization, biodiversity loss, and ecological footprint in BRICS economies using a quantile regression (MM-QR) approach over the period 1990–2020. For robustness, this study employs the Dumitrescu-Hurling causality panel test to explore and validate the long-term association among the variables. The empirical results reveal that urbanization, economic growth, land use changes and sand mining are all positively associated with environmental degradation in the long run. Results further indicate that weak environmental governance and biodiversity loss leads to deterioration of environmental quality. Overall, the study infers that sand is a common pool resource that is prone to the tragedy of the commons, posing a real threat to the environment and economic development in BRICS economies. The results highlight the importance of sustainable sand mining practices and environmental governance in promoting environmental quality and offset the negative consequences associated with this activity. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

This complexity often leads to challenges in communication and collaboration, especially in situations where conflicting parties are involved. Therefore, this study was conducted with the aim of strengthening conflict resolution strategies in the context of biodiversity conservation projects. To achieve this objective, the research focused on two main aspects which include the identification of key performance indicators as perceived by environmental experts within a conservation project, and the assessment of conflict management styles employed by these experts. The study performed literature review to select 27 basic performance indicators for biodiversity conservation projects. A survey of 25 experts collected data on their perception regarding the indicators and conflict management style. Using multi-criteria analysis, specifically the direct analysis of a performance matrix, this study ranked 27 basic indicators used to evaluate conservation project performance. The results showed that the most important indicator was “natural regeneration capacity”, the most used conflict management style was “integrating”, and the least used one was “avoiding”. The study recognized that conflicts, when managed effectively, can reveal different perspectives on challenges. Therefore, competitive interests can stimulate innovative problem-solving and generate productive results. This study enhances understanding of conflict management styles, which contributes to improved conflict resolution and, ultimately, better management of biodiversity conservation projects. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Alpine meadows are an important ecosystem in the Three-River Source Region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The dominant plant species in alpine meadows undergo changes during degradation that may directly or indirectly influence soil functionality. In this study, the effects of variations in the dominant plant species on soil physicochemical properties and multifunctionality were analyzed. Quadrats with different dominant plant species were classified as CY (for Cyperaceae), CGF (for Cyperaceae-Gramineae-Forbs), and FB (for Forbs). The results showed that, for all cases, there were significant correlations among TN (Total Nitrogen), SOC (Soil Organic Carbon), TP (Total Phosphorus), soil water, and bulk density, whereas TK (Total Kalium) showed no clear correlations with other properties. The most significant correlation between plant community characteristics and soil physicochemical properties was found in CGF because of the higher biodiversity and intensity of intermediate competition. Species with absolute dominance had stable positive or negative effects on soil multifunctionality at almost all thresholds. The effects of Cyperaceae decreasing and Forbs increasing on soil multifunctionality were nonlinear. Turning points of important values of Cyperaceae (∼0.38 and 0.66) and Forbs (∼0.34 and 0.69) were observed in dominant species changes. The different effects of Cyperaceae and Forbs on soil multifunctionality before and after the turning point indicate that the effect of plant communities on soil multifunctionality depends more on the interactions between species that remain rather than those that depart. The results of this study can guide efforts to maximize both plant communities and soil multifunctionality for the protection and restoration of alpine meadows. © 2023},

	abstract = {Upstream reservoir impoundment has brought adverse impacts on the downstream river-connected lakes, including lower water levels, frequent droughts, and reduced biodiversity. Existing research on ecological reservoir operation focused more on the effectiveness of operation redesign for ecology improvement, but less discussion on why they are eco-friendly. In this paper, the reservoir operation mechanisms targeting lake ecology are explored from three perspectives: ecological impoundment strategy, dominant characteristics of ecology and conservation tradeoffs, and critical parameters of the rule curves. Therefore, a reservoir operation framework, which couples the lake hydrological response model and multi-objective optimization model, is developed in this study. This framework is to maximize the water conservation and lake ecology benefits, assessing the latter by ecological reliability and ecological water shortage rate. Taking the Three Gorges Reservoir and Dongting Lake as the case study, operation rule curves are optimized for different impoundment strategies. The results indicate that impoundment with early storage time and slow storage rate can improve the ecological reliability and ecological water shortage by 9.90 % and 16.39 % than conventional operation. The ecological objectives are weakly competitive or synergistic when impounding fast, but strong competitive when impounding slow. Meanwhile, as the storage rate declines, the ecological improvement causes a slight decrease in power generation and a significant decrease in water supply. Finally, the crucial parameters of the rule curves are explored and appropriate values are recommended for different ecological preferences. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Biodiversity plays a vital role in human survival and development. In the context of economic globalization and increasingly serious global biodiversity loss, the division of global biodiversity responsibilities and cross-regional cooperative conservation are important parts of species conservation. In this paper, an environmentally expanded multi-regional input-output analysis model is used to measure biodiversity loss footprint (overall footprint, internal footprint and external footprint), which not only covers the interference within the region, but also traces the influence out of it. In addition, structural path analysis and social network analysis were used to identify the transmission process and divide the biodiversity protection communities in various countries. The results show that: (1) There are significant differences among countries in terms of biodiversity loss footprint. The top five countries in terms of overall biodiversity loss footprint are Indonesia, China, the United States, Mexico and Brazil, but they have different impact modes on biodiversity; (2) While most of the footprint of biodiversity loss occurs within the region, more than a quarter of the footprint is due to global production chains outside the region. The study concluded that through the global production chain, species will eventually be influenced by the United States, Japan, India and China; (3) Among economic sectors, agriculture has the largest direct biodiversity footprint. Food & Beverages sector has the largest indirect biodiversity footprint; (4) Eight biodiversity protection communities have been formed around the world, including source community and mixed community of biodiversity protection, each four. Among them, the source community is represented by Indonesia, India, Australia, the Philippines and Thailand in South and Southeast Asia, while the mixed community is mainly composed of China, Japan, Cameroon and Vietnam in East Asia and South Africa. In order to protect biodiversity effectively, different strategies are proposed for different types of communities. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Within this context of sustainability, persistent conflicts between key paradigms create substantial barriers against—but also opportunities for—developing new conceptual approaches and theoretical models to understand and respond to these critical issues. Here, I revisit paradigmatic tensions to assess their impact on research and debate on sustainability, ethics, and business. Drawing on relational ontology and values of nature that recognise humanity’s tight embeddedness within the planetary ecosystem, I examine how conceptualising sustainability as the pursuit of life might generate new insights for research and practice into the wider transformation needed to sustain and restore socioecological systems. The aim here, however, is not to reconcile these paradigmatic tensions but instead use them as a fruitful lens for examining the implications for sustainability, while acknowledging the inherent ethical dilemmas for individuals, organisations, and society. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {It is necessary to classify, quantify, and evaluate ecosystem services (ES) for understanding related ecosystem value. Garden pea (Pisums ativum L.), also called pea, herbaceous annual plant in the family leguminous, grown nearly worldwide for edible seeds. It contributes to the sustainability of the agricultural ecosystems. However, there is no information about the provision and consumption of ES in garden pea fields. The main objective of this study was to provide a first evidence base from ES provided by garden pea fields. Therefore, we developed a quantitative framework for assessing and quantifying ES of four different varieties of garden pea. For this purpose, a field experiment was carried out in the research farm of Gorgan University of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources (northeast of Iran), during 2019–2020. In this study, we developed a framework for quantifying of ES based on the modified Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA). The results showed that garden pea cultivation increased microbial respiration, soil organic matter, and carbon accumulation. Based on the results, varieties had significant effects on soil carbon accumulation. Peas Wolf and Pea Wolf cultivars with 1206.6 kg/ha carbon accumulation had the highest amount, and Reyna cultivar with −1876.9 kg/ha carbon accumulation had the lowest value. In this experiment, Peas Wolf and Utrillo cultivars provided more ES in terms of dry weight, the number of nodule, and root volume as nitrogen biofixation potential. In general, Peas Wolf compared to Utrillo cultivar was more successful in providing regulating services. However, Utrillo cultivar provided more provision services (14,520 kg/ha green yield, 23,680 kg/ha green biomass and 23,62% protein). In addition, different cultivars of garden pea had positive effects on the transfer of carbon from the atmosphere to the soil. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

For this purpose, crude SL were produced from organic waste (a mixture of molasses and winterization oil cake) through solid-state fermentation (SSF) in a 22L pilot-scale aerobic bioreactor using the yeast Starmerella bombicola as SL-producing microorganism. The crude material extracted from the SSF exhaust solid contained several forms of SL and it was purified using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and characterized by means of Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) yielding a high-purity C18 lactonic SL (>99%). This pure SL was used to enhance the batch anaerobic digestion of source-selected biowaste, mainly composed by kitchen waste. The best dosage of SL was in the range of 0.02–0.04 g SL/g TS, with an increment of methane yield of 41% in NmL/g VS. The presence of SL did not significantly alter the structure of the microbial community or general biodiversity. In summary, we propose a circular approach for waste valorisation in which different organic waste streams are combined in a biorefinery-like configuration, where the solid-state fermentation is used to produce SL and results in an enhanced bioenergy production. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Humanity is continuing a path towards ecological instability. While resource consumption is unprecedented, significant parts of the human population are still deprived of decent living. The safe and just operating space postulates that it is possible to simultaneously stay within ecological limits and fulfil basic needs. However, evidence that such a state can be achieved given existing population and available technologies is lacking. Here, we attempt to show whether a safe and just space exists by modelling material and energy requirements for satisfying basic needs with various technological scenarios. Environmental impacts of a basket of products representing basic needs satisfaction are measured through life cycle analysis and compared to planetary boundaries for the first time. We find that all planetary boundaries considered can be respected for 8.0 and 10.4 billion people with a probability of 81% and 73% respectively. However, this requires a fossil-free energy system, and an essentially vegan diet as well as no additional cropland conversion. To actually create and enlarge a safe and just operating space, carbon dioxide emissions, biodiversity, Phosphorus and Nitrogen emissions would need to be further reduced, mainly by improved agricultural practices and material circularity. Significance Statement The purpose of this study is to find out if humanity can fulfil basic needs for all humans without destabilizing the Earth system. This information is relevant for identifying pathways to futures in which all humans can live good lives without compromising the livelihoods of future generations. Our results show that it is theoretically possible to satisfy the basic needs of 10.4 billion people within ecological limits. However, large-scale transformations in all sectors and dietary changes are necessary to guarantee safe climate conditions. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {This study examines biodiversity reporting by UK-listed companies. An instrument is developed, based on earlier research, and used to analyse biodiversity-related disclosures as either policy considerations or actions taken to conserve biodiversity. A mixed design is employed. The extent of reporting, information content of disclosures and their readability are used to provide an overarching perspective on how firms internalise biodiversity. Outliers are identified and their reports are examined interpretively to identify how leading reporters understand biodiversity as a policy imperative and factor it into their operational and managerial performances. This qualitative analysis highlights best practices that can be used by other entities interested in developing the accounting and management infrastructure necessary for reporting comprehensively on biodiversity. Best practices are, however, isolated and stand in stark contrast with how organisations are dealing with biodiversity on average. At the policy level, there is little on how biodiversity is defined and the rationale for wanting to protect biodiversity. When it comes to performance, few organisations are setting detailed biodiversity-related targets linked clearly to operational plans, risk assessments and key performance indicators. Post-implementation reviews of conservation initiatives are seldom conducted and biodiversity is not being factored into valuations, cost assessments and project appraisals. Understanding these limitations is timely given the international community's recent efforts to develop standards for extra-financial reporting. The results will be relevant for regulators, scholars and practitioners interested in advancing the quality of biodiversity reporting and factoring biodiversity into mainstream business discourses. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The new roadmap of the European Union (EU), the European Green Deal, aims at tackling climate adaptation, energy, biodiversity, and pollution challenges. To contribute to such aim, the latest EU Renewable Energy Directive defines for the first time renewable energy communities. Among them, Photovoltaic-Green roof Energy Communities (PGECs) emerge as a potential option in urban areas. This paper investigates whether and under which conditions PGECs are capable to meet the objectives of the European Green Deal in an economically convenient manner. Since some conditions are context-specific, this research is showcased using a case study (Luxembourg). First, European legislation was reviewed to determine the suitable legal model for PGECs. Second, a systematic literature review helped identifying lifecycle costs and benefits of photovoltaic-green roofs and their value ranges. Third, a model for probabilistic social and private cost-benefit analyses was developed and tailored to Luxembourg. Lastly, Scenario Discovery was used to identify the ranges of input values leading to desirable net present values. Results show that PGECs can contribute to achieving multiple objectives of the European Green Deal in an economically convenient manner. From the societal perspective, PGECs are found to be economically convenient for any cost, benefit, and discount rate in the case study. From the private perspective, PGECs remain convenient in 62% of the scenarios, with green roofs’ installation cost and electricity generation benefit playing pivotal roles. This paper presents a rare combination of probabilistic cost-benefit analyses and scenario discovery, It supports policymakers designing incentive schemes for PGECs, and can be replicated in other countries. © 2023},

	abstract = {Multi-family housing construction (MFHC) with wood instead of concrete as frame material results in lower greenhouse gas emissions. Hence, substituting wood for concrete in MFHC in Sweden until 2030, and onwards to 2070, could be a promising climate change mitigation option. But to what extent, and how would it impact Sweden's forests? Here we assess climate and biodiversity implications - in terms of the area of old forest - of a completely wood-based future MFHC in Sweden. The wood required is assumed to be exclusively sourced as additional fellings in Swedish forests, thus carbon leakage from wood imports as well as displacement of other wood uses can be disregarded. Different types of timber frame systems and the role of varying future dwelling sizes are considered. We find that the wood needed for a complete substitution of concrete would result in very minor increases in harvests. We further register slight net additional climate change mitigation, irrespective of the wood construction system. There is a small tradeoff between climate change mitigation and biodiversity, as the area of old forest reduces slightly. The largest climate benefit, and lowest impact on Swedish forests, is provided when using timber-light frame combined with reduced dwelling size. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic initiated an unprecedented surge in production and consumption of personal protective equipment (PPE). There is still an elevated rate of consumption as the world is entering the post-COVID-19 pandemic period. Given the secondary environmental risks related to PPE, it is necessary to critically analyse the threats of PPE to ecosystems and human health. This review examines production, consumption, and mismanagement of PPE from the view of life-cycle and adverse impacts of the main components of PPE, including microplastics, metals, additives, and dyes, on ecosystems and human health. CO2 emissions, energy consumption costs and loss of biodiversity are the major environmental impacts from production of PPE. Oxidative stress is the most important toxicological impact of the main ingredients of PPE on ecosystems, followed by growth inhibition, DNA damage, and water eutrophication. In contrast, adverse effects on human health include organ damage, immune system damage, nervous system damage, carcinogenesis, and reproductive disorders. The complex and diverse environmental impacts generated by PPE in various stages, including climate change, ecological toxicology, human health, and other aspects, which posed a great challenge to conduct a life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA) related to PPE. Another goal of this review was to investigate the necessity and propose a conceptual framework for conducting a cradle-to- cradle LCIA of PPE, which incorporates sound management strategies for the manufacture and disposal of PPE to reduce the entry of disposable PPE into the environment. The findings could provide reference for the prevention and control of the secondary environmental risks related to PPE caused by major global public health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2024},

	abstract = {Diversified crop rotation is crucial for maintaining sustainable agricultural production by improving resource use efficiency, balancing soil nutrients, and preserving biodiversity. Despite these benefits, there is a notable gap in research concerning the nutrient transport characteristics in cash crop-grain rotation systems. This study was to investigate: (i) the nitrogen (N) uptake and distribution among the different plant organs in rotation crops; (ii) the N footprint in different growth seasons in response to crop N fertilization and residual N in the soil; and (iii) the influence of environmental factors on the productivity and N footprint in cash-grain rotation systems. In the three-year rotation system, N fertilizer was applied at the rates of 220, 175, and 130 kg N eq ha−1 for maize, and 300 and 240 kg N eq ha−1 for garlic. Results showed that maintaining a high N application rate during the garlic season and appropriately reducing it during the maize season (G300M175) enhanced N transfer to the grains of maize, increasing maize N use efficiency by 18.9%, while simultaneously increasing garlic dry matter and N accumulation. While the maize yield remained stable, garlic yield decreased with the reduced N rate, resulting in a significant reduction in N footprint. Water supplies (precipitation and irrigation) positively impacted dry matter accumulation, N absorption and yield, while reducing N footprint in both crops. Elevated air temperature favored maize yield but hindered garlic production and raised garlic N footprint. Although N fertilizer increased N footprint per unit land area (NFa), it decreased the N footprint per unit N uptake by crops (NFn) while boosting crop yields. Maintaining a suitable N input rate for cash crops in previous season while reducing N input in the following season staple crops can enhance the whole systems’ productivity while decreasing the nitrogen footprint. © 2024},

While many tools that measure businesses' biodiversity footprints have recently emerged (“biodiversity indices”), it is unclear whether they really allow companies to measure what the Global Biodiversity Framework requires. Identifying gaps in biodiversity indices concerning the GBF would aid businesses and strengthen its implementation. To fill this gap, here we assessed the degree of the alignment between the indices and the Global Biodiversity Framework. The businesses’ biodiversity indices identified by the European Union Business @ Biodiversity Platform and the Taskforce for Nature Financial Disclosures were selected. A semi-quantitative gap analysis was applied to compare their capabilities against the metrics extracted from the Global Biodiversity Framework. The glaring gaps were found in existing biodiversity indices in the coverage of the metrics needed to support the implementation of the Global Biodiversity Framework by businesses. Metrics related to ecosystem integrity, connectivity and restoration, nature-based solutions, sea use change, aquatic biodiversity, genetic diversity and resources, the territory and knowledge by Indigenous Peoples, and urban green and blue spaces were insufficiently addressed by most available biodiversity indices. There is an urgent need to develop integrated biodiversity indices if businesses are to effectively measure and disclose their impacts on biodiversity in a way more consistent with the Global Biodiversity Framework. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Grazing lands provide many goods and ecosystem services, such as forage, livestock, soil carbon (C) storage, biodiversity, and recreational opportunities. Ensuring the long-term sustainability of grazing lands requires optimal management to simultaneously balance livestock productivity for sustaining human food and nutritional demands while reducing environmental impacts, such as greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and soil degradation. In this paper, we revisit grazing management in grazing lands exposed to different grazing systems. In Section 2, we briefly review parameterization and multi-faceted goals for sustainability of grazing systems considering broader sustainability from economic to environmental aspects. We also discuss the inconsistencies between grazing researchers and ranchers’ practices. In Section 3, we review the separate experimental data to examine the impacts of multi-paddock rotational grazing on soil carbon, nutrient and GHGs. In Section 4, we present status and upcoming challenges in monitoring and upscaling of grazing ecosystem research and management. In Section 5, new concepts of multiple source monitoring networks are presented that enable the analysis of scale-dependent processes. Finally, we point out future directions for monitoring and assessment of managing soil C and GHG emissions from grazing lands. The results show that the inconsistences are essentially due to (1) effects of spatiotemporal scales on both economic and ecological outcomes, and (2) simplistic representations of multi-faceted grazing systems and sustainability. The development of multi-faceted monitoring systems needs to be further parametrized and standardized to make consistent for meaningful and comparable assessment of grazing management impacts on SOC and GHGs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper analyses the environmental degradation associated with the ecological footprint in Latin America. The studied region has an important feature of less industrialization and are having high advantage of biodiversity. As ecological footprint is a comprehensive indicator of environmental deterioration because it assesses the impact of all human activities on nature. This research examines the effect of economic complexity and the natural resources rents on the per capita ecological footprint in Latin America. To assess the sensitivity of the parameters and to capture the impact of the growth in the structure of the industrial sector for the region, the study includes globalization, inequality, internal credit and trade as additional covariates. The theoretical framework comprises the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) and for the methodology the quantile regression approach, proposed by Canay (2011), Powell (2016) and Machado and Santos Silva (2019), has been used in this study. The study found that the impact of economic complexity and the natural resources rents is heterogeneous throughout the distribution on the ecological footprint. It is also observed that the level of inequality for the utilization of region-specific climatic distribution of natural resources, increases the ecological footprint in the lower quantiles, while in the upper quantiles, it decreases the same. This study provides a new approach to analyze the degradation of environment in countries with high dependence on natural resources rents and high-income inequality. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Ecosystem service is widely acknowledged as a mainstream and valuable concept for the sustainability-oriented decision-makings on meeting the fundamental needs for improving human well-being and addressing the critical challenges such as food scarcity, land degradation, climate warming, biodiversity loss, flood risk and population pressure. Different ecosystem services arise through combinations of social-ecological drivers and interact with each other across scales. Essential to design effective policy interventions toward achieving sustainability is clarifying the relationships among ecosystem services and the underlying drivers at different scales. Therefore, this study analysed the spatial patterns and relationships of six ecosystem service supplies and examined their responses to ten social-ecological drivers at three spatial scales in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in 2015. Our results revealed differences in ecosystem service spatial pattern robustness across scales. The trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services changed less in direction and more in strength at the three scales. The relationships between the provisioning service and the other ecosystem services were mostly antagonistic, and those between the regulating services and cultural service were predominately synergistic. Different types of ecosystem service bundles comprising different abundances of services were detected, and reconfiguration of ecosystem service bundles occurred as the scale changed. The directions of social-ecological drivers’ impacts varied across ecosystem services, and the magnitudes of social-ecological drivers’ impacts on the services varied at different scales. Across the three spatial scales, the most influential driver of ecosystem services was the normalized difference vegetation index, to which different ecosystem services responded diversely and non-linearly. Our results advocated the multiscale assessment of ecosystem services and social-ecological drivers and emphasized the necessity of embracing scale dependency in the hierarchical governance of ecosystem services. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The present study investigates the biodiversity disclosure practices of the 101 public organizations in Québec, Canada. The study's purpose is to better understand the internal dynamics that may explain the various shortcomings observed in official documents. To meet this objective, Goffman's dramaturgical frontstage/backstage analogy is used. In particular, the current study employs a content analysis of the sampled organizations' action plans and annual reports (N = 505) as well as interviews (N = 35). The results highlight both significant gaps in Québec's public organizations' biodiversity disclosure practices and a tendency for these organizations to make symbolic rather than substantial commitments. Also, problematic behaviors that can affect transparency were identified among the organizations—specifically, bricolage of actions and the manipulation of figures to influence stakeholder perceptions. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Such infrastructures are produced and managed by practitioners. Analogous to engineering inspection, the ecological performance of such infrastructures also needs to be evaluated: not only for assessing benefits against added costs but also for generating valuable lessons to improve future practices. The practitioners, however, are often not equipped with knowledge background and tools to evaluate biodiversity. This paper bridges the knowledge gap of practitioners in assessing the biodiversity of urban green infrastructures. Research methods include literature review and synthesis, interviews with experts, and case studies. The outcomes of the study include a methodological framework for streamlining biodiversity assessment by practitioners, a recommended list of species for monitoring, simple yet scientifically sound survey methods, and a decision table. Case studies indicate that the research outcomes are useful in evaluating the biodiversity of the studied sites.

The LULC change has a significant influence on the quality of natural habitat and ecosystem functions. The study assessed and modeled the habitat quality of the Kaffa biosphere reserve using the “Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs” (InVEST) model. The InVEST model helps to evaluate the impacts of landscape changes on the quality of habitats in combination with habitat-threatening factors. The mean values of the habitat quality indices in 1986, 1999, 2009, and 2019 were 0.80, 0.77, 0.67, and 0.65, respectively. Furthermore, the habitat quality for the years 2034 and 2049 would decrease continuously to 0.61 and 0.60, respectively. Settlement and agricultural areas have a lower habitat quality index compared to the other native habitats. This confirms the expansion of human-modified landscapes such as settlement and agricultural lands in the biosphere reserve, which, in turn, caused degrading the habitat quality of the biosphere reserve. The spatial metrics of patch number, patch density, the largest patch index, and the area mean index showed the prevalence of forest fragmentation. This, in turn, has worsened the overall habitat quality of the biosphere reserve. In addition, the result of the binary logistic regression indicated that the expansion of settlement areas in the biosphere reserve was a significant influencing factor on the habitat quality. Overall, the study results confirmed that the biosphere reserve has both spatial and temporal variability of habitat quality. Therefore, evaluating and predicting the spatiotemporal status of habitat quality under the influence of LULC change can offer a scientific basis for developing strategies for biodiversity conservation and landscape planning. © 2021},

	abstract = {Life cycle assessment is an analysis technique used to assess the environmental burdens of products or production processes. Ecosystem services is a concept used to understand the ways functioning ecosystems support human wellbeing. Both are used to understand how anthropogenic pressures impact the environment. The integration of ecosystem services as indicators in life cycle assessment is increasingly being explored, however there are several limitations with current frameworks. A brief review of existing approaches found they incorporate ecosystem services as midpoint indicators within traditional life cycle assessment structures and aggregate these impacts under the conventional ‘areas of protection’ (i.e., groupings of impacts). These approaches typically only focus on how product systems negatively affect ecosystem service supply (predominantly through land use) and overlook how product systems use up ecosystem services to mitigate their emissions or how interventions in product systems could improve ecosystem service supply. It is argued by several authors that ecosystem services are better placed as endpoint indicators representing damage to the instrumental value of ecosystems in a manner distinct to existing life cycle assessment impact categories, so that any changes in their delivery should be assessed within a new area of protection. In this paper, the potential for an ecosystem services area of protection within life cycle assessment is explored and a novel framework for modelling endpoint characterisation factors related to ecosystem service impacts that addresses the limitations of existing approaches is presented. The proposed novel framework respects existing life cycle assessment protocols by quantifying the endpoint damage to ecosystem services from product systems alongside existing methodologies for modelling endpoint impacts to ecosystem quality (biodiversity), human health and natural resources. This approach, based on small number of pertinent end-point indicators, has potential to broaden out LCA assessments of product systems and quantify the multiple ways they impact ecosystem services. © 2022 The Author(s)},

In order to determine the proper fertilization strategy, it is necessary to evaluate the effects of partial substitution of nitrogen fertilizer with organic amendments on soil quality and crop yield, as well as their decisive factors. A five-year organic substitution field experiment was set up to investigate the effects of partial substitution of chemical fertilizer with stover, cattle manure and biochar on soil quality, soil microbial and nematode diversities and crop yield in a maize (Zea mays L.) field of Northeast China. Our results showed that organic substitutions increased soil quality and manure substitution increased maize yield through changing the composition and functional group of soil biota. Bacteria played important roles in determining the maize yield, but the beneficial effects were contingent on the different types of organic substitution. Stover substitution improved soil quality through increasing bacterial diversity but may lead to the competition of nitrogen between microorganisms and crops. Compared with conventional fertilization, manure substitution provided resources with suitable C/N ratio (6.82) and resulted in the higher maize yield, but the soil quality improvement was weaker under manure substitution than under stover substitution. Biochar substitution reduced the relative abundance of plant-parasitic nematodes but caused an increasing of potential pathogenic fungi for maize. Comprehensively, stover substitution is the most promising fertilization regime for maize in Northeast China from the perspective of soil quality and soil biodiversity. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The field work based on mixed methods combined 20 qualitative interviews with a survey to 277 Danish certified organizations. Findings show that the key stakeholders for EMSs - namely, employees and customers - are rarely involved to set the environmental objectives, as top managers in collaboration with environmental managers set them. Objectives within the areas of energy/climate, waste, and water consumption are the most common ones, while the least used ones deal with biodiversity, lifecycle assessments and design. Thus, the rather operational focus of the EMSs is highlighted. Implications for organizations, managers, and other stakeholders are discussed. © 2021 The Authors},

The influence of these changes on the distribution and abundance of phytoplankton communities in the YRE are still inadequately understood. We studied the spatial distribution of environmental factors, zooplankton abundance and biomass, and phytoplankton abundance and community in the YRE at different WSRS stages during 2018 (WSRS year) and compared with corresponding durations in 2017 (non–WSRS year). Our results demonstrate that the WSRS (1) promoted phytoplankton growth in estuarine areas at the pre-stage and decreased phytoplankton abundances in the entire study area during the inter-stage, (2) decreased phytoplankton biodiversity and increased abundance and proportion of Synedra sp., and (3) led to a temporary rapid increase in zooplankton abundance and biomass. Bottom–up effects dominated phytoplankton variability at the pre- and end-stages of the WSRS, while top–down effects dominated the inter-stage. Redundancy analysis indicated that phytoplankton assemblages were primarily influenced by nitrate and the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus at the pre-stage, by zooplankton abundance and biomass at the inter-stage, and by ammonium and dissolved silica at the end-stage. Our findings provide essential information for understanding and predicting the changes in the phytoplankton community due to increases in hydrodynamics, nutrients, and turbidity conditions in river estuaries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Understanding the spatiotemporal pattern and interaction among regulating ecosystem services (RES) is essential for human well-being in and outside mountains. However, spatial differentiation of the relationships among multiple mountain RES is poorly understood. Accordingly, we investigated the spatiotemporal distribution and correlation of five RES in the Qilian Mountains from the perspectives of nonlinearity and vertical zonation. Our results showed that RES were spatially clustered and RES distribution was constrained by hydrothermal conditions. Positive trends in RES were widespread from 2000 to 2020, with small patches of decreasing water conservation and purification in woodlands and grasslands at middle altitudes. Interactions among RES overall showed spatial and temporal consistency. The nonlinear and synergistic relationship between paired RES was dominant, and conflicts in RES were manifested by decreasing water conservation and purification with increasing vegetation biomass and soil retention, especially in forests. The trade-off relationship was also detected in alpine sparse vegetation, where the biodiversity index decreased in spite of increasing water conservation and purification. In most cases, the magnitude of RES interactions followed the Exponential or Gauss function with increasing elevation. The synergistic relationship was strongest in alpine meadows among biomes, while the trade-off was prominent at an altitude of 2250–3850 m and 4800–5400 m. According to our findings, recommendations for land management are stand density control on the hillside and an establishment of riparian forests in valleys. Meanwhile, protective measures should be considered to mitigate landscape fragmentation in alpine meadows and cold deserts to conserve biodiversity, such as enclosure and grazing prohibition. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Yet, despite growing public awareness, policies adopted, and research undertaken, societies are far from transitioning to sustainability. The barriers to a transition are complex and diverse. Previous research identified motivational factors that impede societal change: knowledge, values, self-interest, structural problems, concepts of normality and emotions. The aim of this paper is to investigate if these factors are reflected in comments about meat and animal-derived product consumption. In order to overcome a number of shortcomings of frequently used social research methods (e.g. surveys, focus groups, interviews), we adopt a qualitative content analysis of web news comments. We choose this approach because content analysis is an unobtrusive research method which provides undistorted and hence valuable insights into the attitudes/motivations/emotions etc. of the commentators. The results show that self-interest, concepts of normality as well as emotions such as fear, frustration, anger and lacking trust seem to make a transition to sustainability very difficult. Values appear to both impede and enable sustainable behaviour while knowledge only plays a minor role. These factors in combination with the interdependence of all actors of society might explain why achieving global environmental goals is so very challenging. © 2021},

	abstract = {Continuous cropping of Fenghua taro leads to poor quality. In this research, two pollution tolerant algae, Spirulina platensis and Chlorella vulgaris, were selected as conditioners for continuous cropping obstacles of taro production. The composition, abundance, and biodiversity of the bacteria and fungi communities in soil rhizosphere of continuous cropping were compared to non-continuous cropping, and studied in-depth. These results showed that the growth of taro during continuous cropping, when irrigated with Chlorella vulgaris and Spirulina platensis, was significantly better than the control group without algal cell irrigation. Accordingly, the plant height, leaf length, leaf area, moisture, carbohydrate, and protein in continuous cropping were 128 cm, 69 cm, 56 cm, 72 g/100 g, 10.8 g/100 g and 2.4 g/100 g, respectively, when watered with Chlorella vulgaris. Furthermore, compared with continuous cropping, the abundance of plant pathogens in the taro rhizosphere, fertilized with Spirulina platensis, were significantly reduced, while the corresponding abundance of soil beneficial bacteria was significantly increased. Specifically, the abundance of beneficial bacteria Ceratobasidium and Pulveroboletus increased, and the pathogens such as Curvularia, Erysiphe, and Clonostachys decreased, during continuous cropping when irrigated with Spirulina platensis. Live microalgae, after wastewater treatment, could be used as potential conditioners to avoid obstacles during continuous cropping of taro production. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

We compare it to two non-protected areas, that is, Okha Beach and Beyt Dwarka, known for their high industrial and tourist activity, respectively. Standing-stock surveys were used to collect primary litter data, while questionnaire surveys were used to learn about people's perception and attitude towards the plastic pollution problem in the study area. We found that plastic was the most common component of the litter at all the sites and that it was primarily of terrestrial origin. Compared to non-protected sites, GOKMPA had the lowest litter density but the highest proportion of plastic litter. Single-use plastic bottles were the most counted items at all the sites, regardless of the conservation status of the sites. The majority of people (locals, visitors, and fishers) around these sites expressed concern about waste but were hesitant to take responsibility and discourage or prevent littering. We noted that designating coastal territories as protected areas helps in reducing plastic pollution while also conserving habitat and biodiversity. However, this could change rapidly due to either mishandling of litter within MPAs or neighboring non-PAs, and also because plastics pose an actual toxicity risk when present even at minimal concentrations in the environment. We recommend combining preventive, mitigating, and curative measures in areas where risk hotspots for plastic litter are identified, and such sites must be constantly monitored. Long-term solutions could include transitioning from a linear to a circular economy, which would involve goals for reducing plastic waste and instituting more sustainable production and consumption patterns. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {The Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR) is an ecological security shelter for southeastern China and East Asia. It is necessary to develop scientific land-use management strategies in the Three-River Headwaters Region to achieve the goal of sustainable land development. This study selected six vital ecosystem services (ESs) for the study area namely, water supply, carbon sequestration, soil retention, sand fixation, hydrological regulation, and flood mitigation to quantify and map the spatiotemporal distributions of these ecosystem services during 2000–2018. We also mapped the spatial distribution of biodiversity protection importance in the Three-River Headwaters Region using the MaxEnt model. We further identified the priority conservation areas through the combination of biodiversity and six ecosystem services with different area thresholds and compared the conservation efficiencies in the Sanjiangyuan National Park and the current protected areas in the Three-River Headwaters Region. In addition, we evaluated the relationships between ecosystem services and biodiversity protection importance and the impacts of eleven environmental factors (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index, elevation, slope, temperature, precipitation; wind speed, solar radiation, the proportion of forest land, the proportion of grassland, the proportion of cropland, and the proportion of wetland) on them. Finally, we identified the functional zones based on the ecosystem services-biodiversity bundles and proposed the corresponding management schemes. The results showed that the spatial distributions of six ecosystem services and biodiversity protection importance in the Three-River Headwaters Region were not spatially congruent. With the changes in the area thresholds in extracting priority conservation areas, the protection focus in the Sanjiangyuan National Park and the current protected areas should be updated accordingly. We identified eight ecosystem services-biodiversity bundles in the Three-River Headwaters Region and divided them into five ecological functional zones, based on which then the corresponding zoning optimization management schemes in each bundle and function zone were proposed. Comprehensive consideration of ecosystem services and biodiversity protection importance is insightful for other regions to conserve biodiversity and exploit natural resources simultaneously. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Environmental sustainability is jeopardized if global greenhouse gas pollution and biodiversity depletion increase. Achieving sustainable production and greener growth has been a core challenge for developing economies. Since both financial development and energy consumption contribute to environmental externalities, economic growth would remain uneven and insufficient. Therefore, the current study examines the role of information and communication technologies (ICT), financial development, trade openness, and fossil fuel energy for the rising level of ecological footprints in Pakistan. Moreover, this study unveils the moderating role of ICT and financial development for ecological footprint. This novel research is based on the quarterly data from 1960Q1 to 2019Q4 using non-parametric causality-in-quantiles techniques to test for causality-in-mean and causality-in-variance since there might be no causality in the first moment, but higher-order interdependencies occur. The study findings exposed that financial development, ICT, and fossil fuels have significant predictive power for ecological footprint, demonstrating asymmetric predictability over ecological distribution. Furthermore, ICT and financial development found a significant interaction when it pertains to predicting country pollution levels. Overall, the study contents that the country's emergence needs to enhance the investment volume in cleaner and renewable energy sources (SDG-7: cleaner and affordable energy) and innovative environmental reforms for the industrial sector. The evidence supports the notion that the government should establish strict regulations on industrial smoke, waste, pollution emanations, scrape, transportation, and the burning of plastics and chemicals in the industry. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Given the hazardous impact of carbon emissions, if left unabated, and the benefits of preserving nature's ecosystem, the motivation for this study hinges on analyzing factors that threaten a sustainable environment using two proxies of environmental degradation: carbon emissions and ecological footprint. With a battery of static and dynamic econometric techniques on a sample of 44 selected African countries from 1992 to 2016, findings reveal the following: (1) energy usage deteriorates the environment, and (2) urbanization has asymmetric effects on the environment. Controlling for per capita GDP, financial development and gross fixed capital formation, evidence suggests that per capita GDP has an asymmetric impact, financial development accelerates environmental degradation, while gross fixed capital formation intensifies a sustainable environment.

	abstract = {Growing global demand for natural rubber is driving deforestation due to the expansion of rubber plantations, with consequences for biodiversity, carbon storage, and local communities. There has been little attention given to these issues in Sri Lanka, where rubber production is central to economic growth. Although private initiatives and government regulations aim to reduce deforestation associated with these plantations, it is unclear if these measures effectively protect forests or limit associated risks in the supply chains of companies purchasing Sri Lankan rubber. This paper uses the TRACAST methodological framework and remote sensing to track natural rubber supply chains from Sri Lanka to the U.S and to identify hidden deforestation risks resulting from this trade. We estimate 196 km2 of forest were converted into rubber plantations between 2006 and 2016, including protected forests located in an emerging rubber frontier in southeast Sri Lanka. Our analysis identifies rubber traders and multinational tire manufacturers as key actors that hinder the traceability of rubber back to the plantations. This opacity increases the potential for unsustainably produced rubber to enter global supply chains of transnational corporations such as Loadstar (Michelin) and Nike. Most of these corporations have sustainable procurement policies, but the effectiveness of these policies is compromised by the lack of supply chain transparency. Integrating public and private sector management through inclusive multi-stakeholder initiatives and multi-level land use governance can help overcome these hurdles, prevent future deforestation, and assist Sri Lanka in moving towards more sustainable rubber production. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The results demonstrated that the PACT-WAR process achieved high efficiencies on the removal of COD (92.58%), Tph (96.56%), NH4+-N (99.52%), and TN (71.52%). The PACT process was more favorable to improving the structural stability of activated sludge (AS) and the biodiversity of specific functional microbial communities. Among them, the relative abundance of Sphingopyxis, Flavobacterium, Nitrosomonas and Terrimonas was enriched to facilitate the degradation of phenolic and nitrogen compounds. More importantly, the regeneration efficiency of spent PAC was 83.33% by the WAR process, which would effectively reduce the addition of fresh PAC. The regeneration solution displayed better denitrification capacity as the additional carbon source. Therefore, the PACT-WAR process was an excellent practical process for enhancing CGW treatment. © 2022},

However, the invasion of alien species from inaccessible areas for humans, such as deep sea a largely unexplored ancient area, has not been explored so far. To address the possibility of alien species invasion of deep-sea bacteria into terrestrial soil, the bacteria were isolated from each of 106 deep-sea sediments on a global scale in this study. The results showed that the bacteria isolated from each of 15 deep-sea sediments altered the bacterial communities of terrestrial loam and further led to the damage of soil functions. As an example, a bacterium, identified to be Bacillus meqaterium DP060, was isolated from deep-sea sediment DP060. The results revealed that Bacillus meqaterium DP060 could proliferate in the terrestrial soil to alter the soil bacterial community and subsequent the soil functions, thus yielding alien species invasion. The deep-sea bacteria with the potential of alien species invasion were broadly distributed in deep-sea bottoms of oceans. Therefore, our study provides the first basic biosecurity insight into alien species invasion of deep-sea bacteria into the terrestrial soil and the biosecurity of deep-sea microorganisms should be assessed when performing the scientific researches and the exploration and exploitation of resources in deep sea. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Phytoplankton played vital roles in aquatic biodiversity and monitoring environmental variations due to the rapid succession of their communities. Weekly studies on phytoplankton species composition and abundance were conducted at a newly established free water surface constructed wetland (FwsCW) from July to October in 2019. Consequences of diversity investigation exhibited there were 124 species of phytoplankton collected, including 57 species or taxa of Bacillariophyta, with the average relative abundance of 44.33 %, 34 species or taxa of Cyanophyta (28.25 %), 17 species or taxa of Chlorophyta (22.62 %), and some of the less collected freshwater community representatives (i.e., Euglenophyta (2.2 %), Pyrrophyta (1.68 %), and Cryptophyta (0.92 %)). The survey credibly revealed the effect of environmental variables on phytoplankton community structure was obvious, especially in the first month (July) and the fourth month (October), and the coexisting species or taxa in each adjacent month were greatly different. Since they entered the FwsCW, existing communities had transited to more diverse ones. The results of principal component analysis (PCA) showed that overall communities’ acclimation process was controlled by hydrochemical and hydrological indices. The most direct factors affecting the growth and reproduction of phytoplankton were the availability of nutrients and the water temperature. The investigation was devoted to the study of some environmental variables which affect the structure of the phytoplankton community, and revealed the importance of integrated management of artificial aquatic ecosystem. The findings also proposed that the long-term operation effects of FwsCW could be pre-evaluated via the structural variation of phytoplankton communities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Coal mining play a fundamental role in promoting economic and social progress. However, intensive mining operations have brought enormous ecological risks, such as landform destruction, vegetation degradation and biodiversity loss. Based on the “source-sink” landscape and ecological risk assessment theories, this study proposes a new methodology to comprehensively analyze the mechanism of ecological risk and makes quantitative evaluation taking Pingshuo coal mine area as an example from 2000 to 2017. The results prove that the “source-sink” landscape theory is more consistent with the nature of ecological process to distinguish the ecological risk in mining area. Within the study period, the main risk source of mining areas is the environmental disturbance brought by mining production with a spreading trend, while the pollution risk caused by residents’ life is relatively low but the scope is large. The ecological niche of risk sink (a place where ecological risks disappear) in the study area improved as a whole, the ecological vulnerability and exposure coefficient of risk sink shows a decreasing trend from core mine area to outside, and the trend was not obvious at the end stage, testifying the protective effect of environmental governance. The striking increase areas of comprehensive ecological risk are mostly concentrated in the surroundings of mining production expansion, testifying mining practice has a significant adverse impact on the contiguous natural ecosystem. Any kind of pressure from coal mine operation, residents’ production and natural erosion in mining area should not be ignored, and the high risk areas are markedly clustered around the risk sources. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Pasture-based animal production is a determinant in shaping biomes worldwide, with historical and cultural effects. It affects land use, landscapes, ecosystem conservation, and climate change. Converting forages into high-value-food livestock production evolved as essential for human nutrition and health, economics, and poverty reduction. A better understanding of the interactions of livestock with the environment to fundament alternatives to mitigate impacts of beef production comes up against the scarcity of studies on the environmental impact of livestock systems that include estimates of biodiversity and the availability of specific indicators. In this work, we provide elements to support the proposition of sustainable practices, looking at cow-calf production in different Brazilian biomes to estimate their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use (LU) amidst diverse levels of biodiversity conservation. GHG emissions and LU were analyzed using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. We express the level of biodiversity conservation as average scores (1 = low conservation to 5 = high conservation) of four indicators: native vegetation, monocultures, soil organic carbon, and endangered fauna and flora species in each biome. Respectively in the Amazon, Cerrado, Pampa, and Pantanal, GHG emissions were 7.14, 6.54, 9.10, and 13.49 kg of CO2 equivalent *kg of live weight gain (LWG)−1, the LU was 89.30, 87.94, 158.84, and 307.24 m2y *kg LWG−1, and the mean biodiversity scores were 4.5, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.3. These results demonstrate that the proposed indicators were able to show differences in biodiversity between the studied systems consistent with current scientific knowledge. This information contributes to the definition of different production priorities according to the peculiarities and current levels of biodiversity conservation in each biome. Holistic management and different pasture improvement strategies have been suggested to increase production, decrease environmental impacts, and regenerate ecosystems. Thus, new opportunities arise to mitigate impacts without generating other problems, increase income, improve the quality of life, and preserve sensitive areas that make up the diversity of Brazilian biomes. © 2022},

	abstract = {The vanilla supply chain is characterized by high risk crop management and unstable supply. In order to meet global vanilla demand while improving production sustainability, new approaches considering agro-ecological cultivation systems and transparent supply chain management are needed. In this study, we aim to understand farmers’ preferences towards such alternative vanilla cultivation and marketing systems, and thereby inform the development of a more sustainable vanilla supply chain. We implemented a discrete choice experiment and a survey with 186 farmers in the Península de Osa, southern Costa Rica, and estimated mixed logit and latent class models. We find that surveyed farmers are in general positive about vanilla cultivation and prefer an agroforestry system over vanilla cultivation in forests, crop wild relatives over commercial species, and manual pollination over natural pollination. Farmers prefer to sell green rather than cured vanilla beans, and like to engage in cooperatives that provide training and production contracts with buyers. Preferences are found to differ across farmers and we identify four preference classes. The preference class with the largest average probability (44%) shows the strongest preferences for agro-ecological vanilla cultivation in diversified agroforestry systems, using crop wild relatives and natural pollinators. Furthermore, this class has the highest likelihood to live in areas with restricted land use policies, creating opportunities for the development of more sustainable vanilla cultivation systems conform with the national program of landscape connectivity and biodiversity conservation. We propose a two-tier approach in alignment with observed farmer preferences and with potential for upscaling to similar areas along the Neotropics. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The value of biodiversity to business can be explained by an environmental philosophy spectrum, where perspectives range from anthropocentric (humans are prioritised) to ecocentric (all life is equal), made up of paradigms and values linked to biodiversity protection. We explore the biodiversity values conveyed by the 40 largest corporations responding to the CDP Forest Questionnaire using 28 specific yes/no criteria aligned with the environmental philosophy spectrum. Strong anthropocentric perspectives focused on economic contribution dominated, conveying a desire to protect company reputation, thereby legitimising operations. Corporations seemingly only protect biodiversity that hold material benefits for humans. Some biocentric/ecocentric perspectives were conveyed in terms of extinction risk and sometimes intrinsic value. This could be a response to the accelerating global biodiversity crisis, offering hope corporations can protect all forms of biodiversity and could evidence ecocentric leadership informing business strategy. © 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Floods have huge impacts on biodiversity of terrestrial plants, with the degree of the impacts being affected by various factors, which is evaluated by many methods. The widely used field investigation method is energy and time consuming and not applicable for evaluating the impact of floods on all plants. The weight scoring method and risk index analysis method are less accurate because the influencing factors are ignored. A more convenient and accurate evaluation method is needed. Here, the main influencing factors were sorted into temperature (T), geomorphic change (G), ratio of flood depth to plant height (D), and ratio of flood duration to waterlogging tolerance time of plant (F). The species number of different plants and monthly distribution of annual grasses in each land cover type were calculated. After establishing the impact functions of T, G, D, and F on plants, we proposed an assessment method using the total biodiversity impact index (TBI) and average biodiversity impact index (ABI) representing the total and average impact degree of floods on plant biodiversity. The feasibility of this method was verified using a case study. We concluded that (1) TBI and ABI varied with space; (2) the ABIs of different plants in the descending order were perennial grasses, annual grasses, shrubs, and trees; (3) the monthly average ABIs of different land cover types in the descending order were grassland, shrubland, cropland, forest, town, and floodplain, that of the monthly average TBIs were grassland, shrubland, forest, cropland, town, and floodplain, which are all high in summer and low in winter. This method can be used for pre-evaluation and rapid evaluation of the impact of floods on biodiversity of plants in inundated areas. It can also be used to evaluate the environmental flood risk of dams and embankments and provide quantitative indicators for risk management. © 2022},

Even though the economy is dependent on biodiversity or its ecological processes, few companies develop Biodiversity Conservation Actions (BCA) to benefit ecosystems, despite the growing number of sustainable companies worldwide. Here, we investigated the relationship between sustainability and biodiversity conservation of five sustainable corporations which controls more than 1,130,000 ha in five Brazilian biomes. We hypothesised that sustainable companies develop BCA to mitigate their negative environmental impacts and stimulate the refill of ecosystem services they had used. We analysed 5420 pages of annual sustainable reports between 2011 and 2018, qualifying and quantifying BCA indicated by each year companies' reports. We discovered that 90% of the units did not mitigate any negative environmental impacts. We found no BCA that included all productive units of each company, finding that most of the conservation actions were concentrated in few areas, most of them required by law. Companies are most concerned with how to economise costs of Environmental Management Systems than rebuild the ecosystems. We show a possibility to interrupt the “Jevons Paradox” by implementing BCA into the centre of the sustainability tripod's thinking. Finally, once BCA benefits the ecosystem services, they should be used as a ballast to validate sustained economic growth that respects the current and future generations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

FTIR shows that the bioflocculant modified carriers have amino carboxyl and polysaccharide functional groups. The biofilm formation time is shortened, and the removal efficiency of COD and ammonia nitrogen are 14.14–21.15% and 6.08–15.41% higher than that of polyethylene carrier. Extend DLVO theory shows that bioflocculant modified carriers have lower energy barrier (149.18 kT) than other modified carriers. By immersing modified carriers and ordinary carriers in the bioflocculant bacteria solution, the high-throughput sequencing reveals that the microorganisms attached on the carriers of bioflocculant doped in PLA have better biodiversity and abundance of functional gene expression than others. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The fact that life cycle assessment (LCA) does not properly consider these issues is a serious problem for the aspirations of LCA in the public sphere. This paper focuses on micro- and nano-sized plastics (MNPs), which have the potential to cause a substantial impact on ecosystem quality because of their increased presence in the marine compartment and capacity to affect a greater range of species. The data regarding MNPs’ effect on different aquatic species were extracted from the academic literature. These data were then explored and analyzed to bring to light the possibilities in terms of effect factor (EF) developments and the existing relations between effect on aquatic ecosystems and different parameters such as particle size, polymer type, and shape. No significant difference could be observed between the effect of the different subgroups of MNPs tested when considering a single species. However, when including many species in the analysis, differences could be noted between polystyrene (PS) and other polymer types. The high uncertainty on the developed EFs combined with this lack of statistical difference among subgroups at the single species level suggest that the use of a single generic EF could be appropriate for now. This EF is provided along with Species Sensitivity Distributions developed to allow for a quick visualization of the gathered data used to generate the EFs. This EF can now be used to quantify the physical impact of all MNPs in life cycle impact assessment. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Food production is a major driver of global warming, water scarcity and biodiversity loss. Denmark has set ambitious targets to lower its territorial carbon emissions in the next decades. In 2019, the Danish Agriculture and Food Council announced a strategy to make Denmark's food production systems climate-neutral by 2050. Therefore, detailed information concerning Denmark's food consumption's environmental impacts is required to implement effective climate mitigation and resource conservation policies that lead to positive local to global results. Using an environmentally extended multi-regional input-output (EE MRIO) analysis and the EXIOBASE v3.4 database, we evaluate Denmark's global food-related consumption-based (CB) greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and resource (land and water use) accounts from 1995 to 2014. Although Denmark's CB food-related blue water use remained relatively stable during the studied period, its food-related CB GHG emissions (excluding land-use change emissions) decreased continuously by 30%. Also, Denmark's cropland and grassland footprints for food declined by 16% (3555 km2) and 27% (621 km2), respectively. Almost two-fifths of Denmark's food consumption was produced abroad in 2014, corresponding to 51% of Denmark's food-related CB GHG emissions and land use apiece and 84% of its food-related blue water use. Whereas animal-based foods accounted for the largest share of Denmark's food-related CB GHG emissions, plant-based diets were responsible for the bulk of Denmark's CB land and blue water use. Dietary changes towards plant-based foods are essential to mitigating Denmark's food-related climate impacts. We recommend that Denmark transfers its sustainable food production technologies to its pollution-and-resource intensive food-exporting trade partners to enhance global climate change mitigation and resource use efficiency. © 2021},

	abstract = {Aquaculture is essential to meet the demand for seafood due to the decrease in fish stocks caused by predatory fishing. Even though aquaculture is a sustainable seafood option, shrimp farming is often associated with eutrophication, mangrove destruction, disease propagation, and biodiversity reduction in coastal regions. These environmental problems generate financial losses, and to minimize the impacts on shrimp farms, producers use bioflocs technology and commercial probiotics to improve water quality and be more productive. This study uses emergy and microbiology analyses to estimate the improvement of microorganisms on the sustainability and food safety indicators of three commercial farms that use probiotic and bioflocs technology to produce shrimp. The first farm had 385 ha, a conventional system, stocked 10 shrimp/m2 and used probiotics. It had the best transformity (Tr = 10.6) and emergy yield ratio (EYR = 1.94) but the worst food safety indices for water and shrimp. The second farm also had a conventional system and used probiotics, but its area was 1.9 ha and with a stocking density of 56 shrimps/m2. It had the highest environmental load ratio (ELR = 28.17), but shrimp and water had better food safety indices than other farms. These two farms would have worse sustainability and food safety indices without the benefit of microorganisms. The third farm had 0.3 ha, a system with biofloc technology, and produced 400 shrimp/m2. It had the best renewability (R% = 14.79), environmental load ratio (ELR = 5.76), and emergy sustainability index (ESI = 0.20). Water and shrimp were within acceptable limits of microorganisms, and the type of biotechnology used contributed to different qualities of the final product. The microorganisms from biofloc technology and probiotics improve the sustainability and food safety indicators on aquaculture, but the absence of other sustainable practices limits these benefits. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Food crop yield and species diversity are critical for global population growth, undernourishment, and environmental burden. Crop redistribution is a practical solution to the sustainable intensification of agricultural systems by replacing existing crops with more suitable ones. Here we test this redistribution theory and its impacts on species diversity using six decades of data on the annual world production of 137 food crop products and their average water footprint (WFP). We find the global food crop effective species diversity had an increasing trend from 21 to 27 in recent six decades. Then, we develop a nutrient water footprint productivity index (WFPPI) to optimize crop distribution. Large calorie (+14%), mineral (+25%), and vitamin (+26%) production increases are possible from reshaping the global distribution of 100 crops within the current total WFP and area harvested. Wheat and paddy rice area can reduce by 31% and 34%, respectively, while increasing maize and soybean area by 18% and 40%, respectively. The global redistribution could feed an additional 866 million people while supplying 37% more than the caloric demand for the projected biofuel growth between 2020 and 2030 in the Net Zero Scenario. Such an optimization process does not entail a loss of crop species diversity. With a change of no more than 5%, the stability of the total area harvested for the four largest crops (wheat, maize, paddy rice, and soybeans) is critical for both production and species diversity of all crops. Our results suggest that global crop redistribution provides a promising solution to sustainable production. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Biodiversity is an important indicator to evaluate the sustainable development of human society. To protect the biodiversity on earth, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have set precise requirements. Biodiversity protection and development are closely linked, and its goal is to protect biodiversity in a way that does not destroy essential habitats and ecosystems. China is one of the countries with the wealthiest biodiversity globally, and it is also one of the countries with the most severe threats to biodiversity. This research analyzes the characteristics of China's biodiversity and the threats it faces, and the biodiversity conservation work that China needs to carry out, and pointed out that in the context of COP15 and climate change, the rational development and continuous use of biological resources is an urgent matter related to the sustainable development of humankind. This research synthesizes the most advanced progress on biodiversity in recent decades. Further, we selected more than 20 indicators related to biodiversity and analyzed the current biodiversity situation in China by using spatial panel measurement and clustering methods. The results show that: 1) coastal provinces in China have more invasive species than inland provinces, and the number of invasive species in inland areas decreased with the distance from the seaside; 2) urbanization, including population crowding and land development, have a noticeable negative impact on biodiversity, with the values of −0.09 and −0.46, respectively; 3) The influence coefficients of temperature and precipitation on biodiversity are both significantly positive. Suitable temperature and abundant rainfall are conducive to biodiversity improvement. Based on these results, three policy directions for protecting biodiversity in China or globally were proposed. © 2022},

	abstract = {Clean and sustainable agricultural production that is organic and minimally assisted by chemicals is one of the major challenges of the 21st century. In view of the unpredictable climatic changes, destruction of natural resources, loss of biodiversity, contamination of soil-water interfacial ecosystems due to overuse of fertilizers and pesticides, and towering food demands with a fast-multiplying population. Therefore, polymer-based electrospun micro/nanofibers and their structured assemblies offering design-versatility, manufacturing-viability, and economically efficient scalability can significantly contribute to the agrotechnological revolution and thus exhibit the imminent potential to reform the agricultural system by promoting both yield and environmental sustainability via a significant reduction in the application of chemicals. Agrochemical-based fibrous assemblies with diversified micro/nano-morphological attributes can potentially boost agricultural production, leading to a paradigm shift from the conventional “sow (seeds)-throw (fertilizers)-spray (pesticides)” to smart and clean “fix-it and forget-it” approach for sustainably ensuring agro-yield, agro-practices, agro-crop quality, and agro-economy. However, the viability of the application of such functionally efficient fibrous structures in agriculture and their qualitative parametric analysis and assessments remain unexplored till date. The current analytical overview summarizes the applications of electrospun assemblies in a variety of controlled agrochemicals (such as fertilizers, pesticides, and biocontrol agents) delivery systems, seed coating, sensors for soil and crop quality, and protective clothing for farmers. Integrated decision-making methodologies (SWOT and TOWS) were applied to evaluate and develop effective and adaptable strategies to improve the production chain and promote environmental sustainability. The review extends further to the potential concerns associated with electrospun mats in agricultural applications along with some novel insights to address the apposite challenges so as to foster prospective designing and commercialization of innovative biodegradable and sustainable nanostructured materials for precision agriculture. © 2022},

	abstract = {This study aims to analyse the shoreline oscillations of three estuarine Islands in Sundarban delta and its impact on mangrove forests around the Islands. Six multi-temporal Landsat images spanning 42 years (1975–2017) have been used in the study. Band ratio was computed to discriminate the water line from the land, which was later digitized. Digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS) was employed for estimation and analysis of the shorelines changes by End point rate (EPR) model and Linear regression rate (LRR) model after laying transects offshore of the baseline. Sea level and topography of the islands have also been analyzed. To assess the mangrove health, time series Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) analysis has been performed using the Mann Kendall Tau statistics and Sen's slope. Mangrove degradation maps were produced from the data and combined with evidences collected from field works. The results point to a very dynamic shoreline ensuing in erosion of mangrove forests while some areas do show encouraging trends due to sustained accretion especially in the southern and eastern parts. Overall erosion is higher than accretion in the Islands. Results show that NDVI has been decreasing along patches that are near to erosion hotspots irrespective of climatic trends. Thus it can be concluded that mangrove forests are under severe stress due to shoreline ingression and sea level rise and not climatic alterations. Going forward this work could provide significant information on the nature of shoreline changes and could assist in sustainable development for Sundarban biodiversity niche management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The review identified 277 different sustainability indicator frameworks that have been applied to cities and undertook a detailed assessment of the most commonly cited of these. Consumption-based footprint studies were separately assessed to determine the extent to which they measure SJS indicators for cities. Both indicator frameworks and footprint studies had a focus on boundaries of increasing risk, including carbon, water, and land use; however few measured highly exceeded boundaries including nitrogen and phosphorus use, biodiversity, and possibly chemical pollution. Social impacts were well covered in indicator frameworks, except food intake, but largely absent from footprint studies. Cities are largely not measuring their impact on planetary tipping points or transboundary impacts, risking resolving some environmental issues while exacerbating others. © 2021},

Food production and consumption is the primary source of anthropogenic Nr emissions. Currently, the research on China's nitrogen footprint lacks the exploration of regional differentiation, and the local virtual Nitrogen factor (VNF) is also insufficient. In this study, we developed localized VNF at the provincial level in China and then applied them to measure the per capita food production Nitrogen footprint of 31 provinces in mainland China from 1998 to 2018 by employing a modified N-Calculator model. We found that the national per capita food production N footprint varied from 15.30 to 21.09 kg/year over the past 20 years. Per capita food production N footprint of 29 provinces increased, ranging from 13% to 113%. The dominance of the food production N footprint of meat gradually increased, and the differences between regions showed a decreasing trend. Finally, we compared the results with different countries based on VNF and 2018 food consumption data.

We review definitions of ‘nature-positive’, highlight differences between ‘nature-positive’ and previous iterations of organizational biodiversity strategies (e.g. net positive impact) and propose four key elements for ‘nature-positive’ strategies: 1) demonstrating positive biodiversity outcomes across the entire value chain (“scope”); 2) buy-in throughout the entire organization (“mainstreaming”); 3) integrated consideration of different components of nature (e.g. both biodiversity and climate; “integration”); and 4) measurable outcomes against a fixed baseline aligned with overall societal goals (e.g. post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework; “ambition”). We analyse trends in biodiversity commitments of the Global Fortune 100 companies and firms that have made recent ‘net impact’ commitments, evaluating alignment with these elements and where possible assessing their evolution since 2016. Uptake of biodiversity commitments has increased since 2016, but with limited progress towards adopting measurable, time-bound commitments (an increase from 5 to 10/100 Fortune 100 firms from 2016 to 2021). We review barriers to business implementation of strategies that can deliver socially equitable and ‘nature-positive’ outcomes. Major improvements are needed in data availability and transparency, regulation and sector-wide coordination that creates level playing fields and prevents impact leakage.

	abstract = {Biodiversity loss driven by intensive livestock farming constitutes a major threat to the resilience of food systems. Grazing-based beef production, by contrast, supports ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. Communicating these benefits to consumers is vital to stimulate demand for pasture-raised beef, with labels being a key means of conveying such credence attributes. Despite extensive research on eco-labels and sustainability certification, however, we know little about consumer perceptions of labels designed to certify and highlight the biodiversity benefits of cattle products. To address this gap, we conducted six audio-only online focus group discussions with forty buyers of beef in Germany to explore consumer perceptions of a multi-level labeling system of labeling designed to differentiate between the conservation measures applied in pasture-raised beef production. Our findings indicate significant challenges for the implementation of such labeling, including low levels of understanding of biodiversity among consumers. Most participants struggled to discriminate between different levels of biodiversity conservation measures and placed little value on the biodiversity benefits of different products. Gaining trust in certification and control procedures is problematic due to the profusion of labeling schemes on the market, especially given consumers' time pressures. However, our findings also highlight consumers' appreciation for biodiversity conservation at local level and higher levels of trust in short supply chains, suggesting opportunities for selling pasture-raised beef at local level. The differences we identify in consumers’ use of labeling can inform further segmentation research and targeted communications to market beef from grazing-based production systems. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Recently, human activities are more and more invasive with respect to biodiversity. Several studies highlighted the key role played by accountants in contributing to the development of tools able to support company in assessing, reporting, and disseminating, as well as accomplishing, the preservation of natural species and ecosystems (King and Atkins, 2016). Corporate reporting of environmental information might increase the credibility of forest certifications, given that some scholars argued that certified forests are not often run, in a sustainable way. Moreover, certifications sometimes cover harmful forest practices (Elad, 2014) and do not ensure a good quality of environmental reporting and performance. The research question therefore intends to explore how extinction accounting and accountability (EAA) is able to reflect ex post the company's business strategy and, at the same time, influence ex ante its formulation by easing the prevention of deforestation risk and addressing the issue of credibility through specific actions. In more detail, the “Emancipatory Framework for Extinction Accounting and Accountability” (EFEAA) (Atkins and Maroun, 2018) was tested using content and interpretative analyses based on the reports inherent to top four companies working in West Europe in the tissue industry, where the preservation of forest heritage is a “compulsory route” for assuring the business sustainability, in terms of both raw material renewal and brand reputation. The findings highlighted the first attempt to carry out a qualitative research over the management of forest issues. In our study, companies tend to report advantages arising from the use of forest, but this kind of disclosure is too generic without providing evidence over the ecosystem services forests produce. Moreover, firm size affects the quantity and the quality of disclosure. At last, managerial implications and future research avenues are outlined and discussed. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {The current emerging economy of the leather industry is primarily linear. Increasingly rigorous legislative specifications for environmental preservation in developed countries have created huge pressure for the leather industry. In light of international efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a circular bioeconomy approach has gained compelling traction in addressing waste management challenges in the leather industry. The concept of circular bioeconomy encourages recycling of wastes yielded from leather processing. However, as of now, there is still a lack of research on bioeconomy concepts in the leather industry context. Hence, the purpose of this study is to put forth the antecedents for circular bioeconomy practices (BEP) in the leather processing industry (LPI), along which a firm can enhance its sustainability. Seventeen antecedents of BEP have been identified from the extensive literature review and experts survey; and their effects on each other are assessed using a blended grey based decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory model. Four major antecedents such as sustainable infrastructure for leather industry, biodiversity, advancement in sustainable products, sustainability threshold levels for bioeconomy technologies are identified as the most crucial key antecedents for BEP in the context of the LPI. In the present study, six antecedents are identified as causal, whereas eleven antecedents are identified as effect group antecedents. The sustainable infrastructure for leather industry is identified as the most crucial driving antecedent in ensuring circular BEP. The findings of this study provide a structural decision support model to the industry managers, practitioners, and relevant stakeholders that assists in knowing the cause-and-effect group antecedents of BEP towards attaining sustainability in the supply chain. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Grazing exclusion is widely used to restore the grasslands that degraded by overgrazing. However, it is not clear how the interaction of above- and below-ground functioning affects the restoration of ecosystem multifunctionality in long-term grazing exclusion. Here, long-term grazing exclusion experiments were performed in a desertified alpine grassland of eastern Tibetan Plateau. We measured critical ecosystem functioning indices including species diversity, community biomass, soil water content and soil nutrient concentrations. Our results showed that both above- and below-ground functioning increased over restoration time, with the mean values increased by 187%, 112%, 195%, 92% and 242% from GE2 to GE12 for above-ground biomass, soil water content, soil organic matter, soil total nitrogen and soil total phosphorus, respectively. Species diversity tended to an “inverted U curve” over restoration time. The response of belowground functioning lagged behind that of aboveground functioning during the restoration process. The trade-off values between above- and below-ground ecosystem functioning in the early restoration stage was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than that in the late restoration stage. We also found that the feedback of aboveground functioning on belowground functioning shifted from negative in the early restoration stage to positive in the late stage. The findings of this study suggested that the interaction between above- and below-ground functioning controls the restoration of ecosystem multifunctionality.

Compared with natural water bodies, aquatic ecosystems replenished with reclaimed water are usually enriched with organic matter, total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP). However, whether and how nutrient stoichiometric characteristic can impact receiving waters' self-purification remains poorly addressed. Here, we evaluated the effects of reclaimed water use on water's self-purification capacity in terms of water quality, sedimentary bacterial diversity, bacterial community structure and function. Results showed that reclaimed water use has improved water quality of domestic polluted urban rivers and increased bacterial genus-level abundance, but failed to directly affect bacterial biodiversity indexes and evenness of receiving waters. Water organic matter input from reclaimed water was the decisive factor in shaping sedimentary bacterial community structure rather than temperature. Meanwhile, compared with non-reclaimed water, reclaimed water replenishment enhanced polluted waters' carbon (C)-, N- and P-removing functions, suggesting an improvement of self-purification capacity. Our findings could improve the understanding of the ecological impact of reclaimed water on urban aquatic ecosystem, and inform the rational use of reclaimed water in urban rivers. © 2022},

	abstract = {Natural ecosystems provide essential regulatory services for local residents and provide benefits to human populations living outside a particular region through various transmission pathways. Accordingly, a spatially explicit conservation network is needed to protect key features from human disturbance. However, existing ecosystem protection surrogates have traditionally focused on biodiversity components or local ecosystem services (ESs). Additionally, conservation plans that protect the delivery value of an ES for regional, social and ecological security are lacking. Herein, we use a multi-objective optimisation method to design a conservation network that maximises the benefits of two regulatory ecosystem services (RESs) in a key eco-region, the Qinling Mountains of China. We identify a set of alternative conservation networks under different land restriction scenarios for both delivery and non-delivery RESs. Our planning results reveal clear spatial distinction between ES delivery and non-delivery values. Moreover, planning focusing on ES non-delivery values tends to ignore several areas that transmit important regulatory functions to downstream conurbations. Based on comparison of ES distribution, biodiversity richness, and existing nature reserves, we suggest that ES delivery values, especially those flowing along a terrain gradient, should be selected as a key protection proxy to complement nature conservation decisions associated solely with biodiversity indicators. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Mass production and insatiable consumption are leading to enormous waste worldwide, contaminating the entire biosphere, losing biodiversity, and climate change. Craving for materialistic things and buying sprees for newer products indicate the dominant roles of human behavior in imminent ecological, social, and economic crises. However, existing global environmental governance has failed to address the current consumption patterns, particularly in rich countries. There is no inclusive developmental policy that integrates human behavior intervention to reduce unnecessary consumption, closed-loop material flow systems to keep waste out of the system, and economic strategies addressing ecological disaster from a social equity standpoint. The paper is based on a critical literature review of three concepts, relevance of behavioral economics in pro-environmental decision making, scope and limitations of circular economy as technological solutions, and conflicts of ecological economics with dominant neoclassical economics pitting ‘degrowth’ as an alternative. The paper proposes a theoretical concept of a novel economic model (minimalonomics) that aims to provide an institutional framework for a minimalist lifestyle without compromising wellbeing, prosperity, equity, and justice. The model focuses on minimizing consumption at the individual and societal levels, integrating theories and principles of ecological economics and behavioral economics, and efficient application of circular economy. Minimalonomics emphasizes creating a pro-environmental attitude in all levels of society (producers, consumers, and government) and translating the individual's perspective to collective and coordinated action for protecting the biosphere. Contrary to the standard economic approach, minimalonomics restores the value of localization and appropriates local social and cultural norms regarding consumption, waste reduction, and environmental protection; thus, the model is more inclusive. Minimalonomics is a novel concept; therefore, before application to governance and policies, it needs further research on creating theories, developing indicators, and testing them in the field. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Area-Based Management Tools (ABMTs) are spatial instruments for conservation and managing different forms of ocean use. A multitude of ABMTs exists in marine areas within and beyond national jurisdiction, ranging from tools for the regulation of specific human activities (e.g. fisheries, shipping, or mining) to cross-sectoral tools (e.g. such as marine protected areas, MPAs, and marine spatial planning, MSP). By applying expert elicitation and reviewing scientific and grey literature we evaluate the contribution of ABMTs to sustainable development goals (SDGs) as set out under the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including for SDG 14 that directly addresses the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas, and marine resources. We find that fisheries-related and conservation-related ABMTs, and MSP offer the greatest potential contributions to SDG 14 and to SDGs in general. Moreover, there is high complementarity and synergy among different ABMTs for most SDG 14 targets and other SDGs, with the exception of SDG target 14.6 Prohibit fisheries subsidies and SDG 7 Affordable and clean energy. We find that some ABMTs contribute directly to goal attainment, while others contribute in more nuanced or even unexpected ways. Furthermore, context-specific factors that relate to political and legal factors, enforceability, transparency, governance structure, and inclusivity are crucial for unlocking the full potential of ABMTs of attaining multiple SDGs, as shown through examples. The major challenge to face in the next decade is ensuring durable and equitable outcomes from ABMT implementation by coordinating ABMT initiatives established by different organisations and responsible authorities. It is also critical that outcomes are monitored and evaluated across environmental, social, economic, governance, and health dimensions, with indicators addressing management effectiveness and not only ABMT area coverage. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Urban water management has recently been questioned because of the fragmented nature of the urban water system and its linear model. The integration and management of water systems are currently recognized as a socio-technical challenge that must be addressed for a more sustainable urban water management. In the short term, a key factor for its transition will be integration of alternative practices that allow for experimentation, learning, and scaling up. This study aims to identify potential shifts supported by two alternative practices for water reuse: nature-based solutions and water reuse technologies, using circular economy principles as analytical categories. The research uses a case study, the Besòs river of the Barcelona metropolitan area, to show that: i) improving biodiversity and water quality helps to regenerate natural capital; ii) water reuse for streamflow augmentation keeps resources in use and promotes synergies, which benefits social livability; and iii) risk management and a potential fit-to-purpose strategy can marginally help to avoid waste externalities. This research has shown that the CE principles are applicable as a framework for identifying the interconnected shifts promoted by water systems. A reflexive understanding of the alternative practices provides deeper insight into the experiences, barriers, and shifts that allow innovative interactions in specific urban contexts and can deliver additional benefits for society. This knowledge can be useful for integrated urban management; however, further integration of cross-sectoral collaboration and flexibility are required. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Forests in India's Himalayan region are undergoing rapid degradation owing to various climatic and man-made stressors, such as invasive species spread and excessive lopping and harvesting of trees. Invasive plants, such as L. camara, pose significant threats to the rich biodiversity of the region due to their ability to replace native vegetation and spread rapidly under a warming climate. Additionally, chir pines (P. roxburghii) are replacing banj oak (Q. leucotrichophora) forests. Oak forests support rich biodiversity and are also preferred by the local communities for meeting their livelihood requirements. In this study, we ask whether green bonds could be utilized for financing the restoration of desirable forest species and enhancing their resilience to natural hazards such as fires. In particular, we explore the possibility of linking green bond yields to the species composition of forests for incentivizing the protection of oak forests. We develop an optimization model of community led restoration of oak and pine forests that are infested with L. camara. Restoring oak forests mitigates the risk of forest fires, improves forest water supply, and controls the spread of the invasive lantana. Findings indicate that such species composition based green bonds, when coupled with payments for ecosystem services programs, can indeed incentivize higher restoration efforts, resulting in an improvement in the biodiversity richness of the region. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Most “Belt and Road Initiative” (BRI) countries are developing countries in the early and middle stages of economic development and industrialization. The ecological environment in the BRI region is relatively fragile. Therefore, ensuring the green development of the BRI is of great significance for realizing global sustainable development goals. As the largest terrestrial ecosystem, forests can offset carbon dioxide emissions and maintain biodiversity. This paper aims to study the BRI region's timber carbon stock flow pattern and the influencing factors. A multi-regional input-output model and carbon stock-accounting methods are used to analyze the embodied timber carbon stock flows. We also reveal the spatiotemporal characteristics of embodied timber carbon stocks in critical countries. Furthermore, a structural decomposition analysis (SDA) is used to examine the factors that influence timber carbon stock changes. The results show that the timber carbon stocks imported to the BRI region account for an increasing percentage of the global imported volume, while the exported percentage has decreased. Although the BRI region has been a net export, the net export volume has shown a declining trend. China and India are the largest timber carbon stock consumers in the BRI region. The United States, Japan, and Germany are the main export destination countries of timber carbon stocks outside the BRI region. The major source countries of timber export have transferred to developed countries outside the BRI region due to the requirement of forest certification systems for combating illegal logging. The changes in the import and export of embodied timber carbon stocks are mainly affected by the negative effect of timber carbon stock intensity and the positive effect of per-capita final demand. The analyses indicate that the developing countries in BRI region with abundant forest resources no longer rely on deforestation to export raw materials in exchange for low profits. Instead, they are gradually enacting sustainable forest management, and exporting wood products with higher added value. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Though the SDGs are all expressly equally important, they vary in complexity, the level of agreement on key concepts and definitions, representativeness of indicators, and availability of data. Here, by analysing quantitatively the implementation of the SDGs in the European Union, we show that the environmental goals are by some distance the most complex and least coherent of the SDGs. We highlight the need to improve data availability and prioritise both monitoring and strengthening of coherence within and among biodiversity and climate SDGs in particular.

	abstract = {Many consumers are willing to move to a more plant-based diet, as is apparent from the increasing demand for plant-based protein sources on many markets. There is scientific evidence that such diets are associated with lower environmental impacts, especially climate impact, land use, and energy use. However, all food production affects the environment, and there is scope for more sustainable food choices even among plant-based foods. We present a method for environmental multi-criteria evaluation of plant-based products to enable communication through a consumer guide, which was developed in cooperation with World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Sweden and involves a real-life case of implementation. The guide included 90 products, divided into five product groups. Four environmental impact categories were evaluated (climate impact, biodiversity impact, water use, pesticide use), to give a fuller, more complex picture of potential environmental impacts of plant-based products than when evaluating only one impact category, such as climate impact. Available environmental footprint data and LCA data adapted for the specific consumer market (Sweden) were used. A method for calculating absolute sustainability thresholds for single products was developed, based on newly published global sustainability boundaries for the food system (Willett et al., 2019). To account for the different dietary functions of food, different thresholds for evaluating different food groups were applied, thus accounting for the role, and to some extent the nutrient content, of different food products. This enabled evaluation of foods based on the same grounds, i.e., using the global sustainability boundaries and the same functional unit for all food products (1 kg of food at a store in Sweden), while visualizing differences in environmental impacts of products within a certain food group. This revealed the best choice of protein sources, vegetables, etc. The method provides a way to use large amounts of data of varying quality, and reduces the complexity in evaluating the environmental impacts of food. It therefore hopefully facilitates sustainable plant-based food choices, for more environmentally sustainable food consumption. © 2020 The Author(s)},

The results show that impacts on water supply and biodiversity dominated ecosystem service losses. Plants with higher water head are more efficient in resource utilization, while the efficiency of plants with gravity dams are generally lower than that with grille weirs under the similar installed capacity. Lixian plant had the best performance based on emergy indicators attributed by the benefits to utilize the renewable source from the regulating flow ability of Shiziping plant.

	abstract = {To remain within the limits of the planetary boundaries and address increasing disease rates due to poor eating habits, there needs to be a major shift in dietary patterns. The composition of an optimal diet changes depending on location, season, and personalized dietary needs. We develop a methodology to build a 500+ food item, nutrient, and environmental impact database specific to a given country and month, which includes several life cycle stages of a food item and calculates impacts depending on from where the item is sourced. This database is then used to develop a detailed and personalized, healthful, low impact diet by using linear optimization. We applied this methodology to several case studies to compare what low impact diets would look like depending on country (Switzerland vs. Spain), season (August vs. February), sex, the inclusion of dietary supplements, and for different diet types and impact categories (climate change and biodiversity loss). Results indicate that, although optimized diets are similar, there are marked differences in the detailed composition depending on country, season, and impact considered, especially regarding legume choice. The lowest impact diet contained local and imported foods as well as fish. Vegan diets had the lowest impact only when incorporating a supplement to meet nutrient needs. We developed a tool to be used for personalized diet composition assessments for any global geographical location and season.

	abstract = {This article reviews the current status of research on urban green and blue infrastructure (GBI) in developing countries. We critically analyzed a total of 283 papers addressing urban GBI in selected developing countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), published between 2015 and 2019. The review aimed to a) analyze publication trends and typologies of urban GBI; b) identify innovative problem-solving measures using urban GBI, and c) understand priorities, differences and similarities in the deployment of urban GBI between the regions. The article identifies a growing interest in the urban GBI concept in the Global South, with a focus on local sustainable development. Urban GBI aims to address issues of urban greenery, land use policies, food security and poverty alleviation. There is a large variation in the number of articles across regions, with Asia, and particularly China, as the subject having a much larger number of publications when compared to LAC and Africa. We found that the focus of research topics varied between regions, reflecting regional development needs, so that urban agriculture research predominated in Africa, and green spaces and parks in Asia and LAC. GBI is still not implemented as a low-impact development or innovative strategy, except in China, where researchers have examined several cases of systemic GBI use for addressing urban issues. More recently, studies began exploring the linkages between nature and cities in light of global environmental issues such as biodiversity loss and climate change. We conclude with recommendations to further examine empirical evidence of urban GBI deployment and its outcomes in the Global South, that could contribute toward conceptualizing natural resource management in a multi-scalar, multi-dimensional, and multidisciplinary framework. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Coastal sand mining for metals involves extraction of heavy mineral sands (HMS), which are sedimentary deposits of dense minerals that accumulate in coastal environments. HMS are localized concentrations of ores such as ilmenite, rutile, leucoxene, and iron, which are sources of metals such as titanium, zircon, iron, sillimanite/kyanite, staurolite, monazite, and garnet. The applications of these metals range from everyday products such as ceramics, paint, and pigments, as well as technologically advanced applications in the airline, shipbuilding, medicine, and defense industries. HMS extraction implies strip mining of coastal areas, which are often unique biodiversity ecosystems, or fragile ecosystems built up on sandy soils or dunes. The loss of such spaces has impacts such as loss of biodiversity and habitats, salt-water intrusion into agricultural lands and increased exposure to sea level rise. As a result of the serious ecological and socioeconomic transformations at such extraction frontiers, these operations cause resistance movements across the world. This article identifies and documents 24 cases of resistance against such operations. It presents the first comprehensive database and analysis of HMS related ecological distribution conflicts. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Hard apple cider is the smallest, but fastest growing sector within the alcoholic beverage industry in the United States (US), and opens a unique opportunity for agricultural entrepreneurship amongst apple orchard owners of all sizes. To support sustainable industry development, it is important to understand which attributes of ‘sustainability’ are most valued by customers, and how those values translate to their willingness to pay a premium for sustainably produced goods. This study surveyed 630 hard apple cider consumers residing in the US Mid-Atlantic region. By using the best-worst choice approach, we presented a two-tiered method which estimated a hierarchal relationship among sustainability attributes that affects a cider consumer's intention to purchase at different price points. ‘Local’ and ‘organic’ held the largest utility and were both highly valued attributes, where consumers will be willing to pay a $10.05 and $6.39 premium, respectively. Agricultural management practices, ‘IPM’ and ‘supporting biodiversity restoration,’ had a positive impact on consumer perception, and commanded a premium of $5.81 and $5.68 respectively. While 'eco-conscious packaging' and 'using renewable energy' did not show substantial utility to the consumer, respondents were still willing to pay a premium for these attributes. Social responsibility attribute levels showed negative utility, however, our analysis found that consumers were still willing to pay a premium of $5.89 for 'charitable donations' and $7.49 for 'community volunteering'. This analysis points to a key challenge in consumer behavior research: the attitude-behavior gap. Effective communication of the specific actions and inactions that take place in sustainable management practices is necessary to convey the proper message to potential consumers. By bridging this gap, hard apple cider producers can better position their product, convey important environmental information for agricultural and business management, and have consumers value their products in a way that make the additional resources allocations to incorporate sustainability metrics prudent in terms of enhanced product profitability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Organic cotton in Brazil shows how initiatives and programs that act above commercial interests could offer guidance and promote cohesion in the ecosystem. To discuss how collaborative achievements and green marketing strategies can impact innovation, a case study on the Brazilian organic cotton ecosystem was conducted. Results showed that the evolution of organic cotton was based on the initiative of designers and branded producers, and on a network that includes Brazilian R&D institutions, international and Brazilian non-governmental organisations (NGOs), smallholders’ associations, and the government. Their joint effort built the ecosystem and led smallholders to adopt sustainable agroecological practices such as rainfed crops, soil nutrition, biodiversity maintenance, and integrated fibre and food crop production. The outcomes of those initiatives are enhanced production, expanding market opportunities, and better social and economic conditions for families in rural areas. For the advance of knowledge about green marketing, this paper offers a perspective that includes a marketing pillar and an ecosystem pillar. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Application of Life Cycle Assessment to marine ecosystems needs further focus. This study applies two existing methods (Langlois et al., 2014 and Emanuelsson et al., 2014) of fishing impact assessment on biodiversity to 125 common fish stocks fished in the 14 marine areas drawn by FAO and proposes operational guidelines for sustainable production and efficient conservation policies. We show that unsustainable fishing is responsible for a loss of up to 30 times the potential yield of major fish stocks such as Atlantic cod, red snapper and bluefin tuna. We identify depleted fish stocks for which biomass is up to 15 times lower than it should be (yellownose skate fished in South America) and stocks facing fishing mortality up to 1.9 × 107 times higher than required to allow sustainable recovery (Pacific Ocean perch fished on the US West Coast). Regarding intrinsic biodiversity, our study shows that we are not able to understand the consequences of overfishing through a cause-effect chain due to lack of science knowledge. However, we display how to limit the impacts on biodiversity by using complementary indicators at species and ecosystem level. The complexity of marine ecosystems and the remaining limits of studied methods are discussed, showing the compelling need for further data collection and analysis, and opening ways for targeted research. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The purpose of this paper is to guide development of supply chains toward more environmentally sustainable practices. We review current and projected technologies and practices for autotrophic microalgae cultivation that promote environmental sustainability. We develop a framework that leverages these studies to propose better management practices (BMPs) for water quality and quantity, biodiversity, or greenhouse gas emissions in concert with productivity and profitability considerations. Some proposed BMPs are linked to numerical environmental targets, such as percent reductions in nutrient loadings to streams, whereas others seek to avoid thresholds leading to adverse health or ecological effects. Still others involve using the best available technologies, developed iteratively through life-cycle and techno-economic analyses. Proposed BMPs for microalgae cultivation focus on water quality and quantity, as well as improving greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to obtain advanced biofuel designation. BMPs must allow producers to meet productivity and profitability targets, as well as environmental targets. These example BMPs characterize the state of science and engineering; thus, they will change over time. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

In the red and lateritic soils of the northeast, central and southern India, land degradation remains a major problem affecting the lives of millions of people. Agroforestry systems with appropriate combinations of arable crops, horticultural trees, and forest tree species are suggested as effective strategies to combat land degradation by restoring biodiversity and ecosystem services but the scientific evidence is lacking for red and lateritic soils of northeast India. In response, a forest deciduous tree species Gmelina [Gmelina arborea Roxb.], a fruit tree mango [Mangifera indica L.], and a legume crop pigeon pea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] were grown solely or in various combinations for ten years (July 2009 to June 2019) in the red and lateritic soil of West Bengal, India to evaluate their role in the restoration of degraded land and the potential for offering multiple ecosystems services. Eleven indicators were selected for evaluating the multifunctionality of ecosystem services having synergies between them. Results after ten years of field experiments revealed that the Gmelina-mango-pigeon pea agroforestry system has provided multiple ecosystem goods like edible seeds (pigeon pea), fruits (mango), fuelwood and timber (mango/Gmelina) sequentially, and was 2–3 times more profitable in terms of net present value compared to sole Gmelina or mango or pigeon pea. This system also offered greater climate resiliency with 1–2 times higher annual biomass production, thus offsetting greenhouse gases emission. The composite evaluation index demonstrated that this system offers the highest level of multifunctionality of multiple ecosystem services. Evidence from this long-term experimentation suggests that the crop-fruit tree-forest tree-based agroforestry system has the potential to restore the land productivity of the degraded red and lateritic soils and provide multiple ecosystem services to millions of people dependent on such land. This system could potentially be out-scaled in many other similar agroecological zones of the world. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Exploring the suitable ecological niche environment for endangered species is essential to maintaining biodiversity and protecting endangered species. The Black-necked Cranes is considered as the environmental indicator and flagship species of the alpine wetland ecosystem, and has been listed as a vulnerable species by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) several times. Nearly one-third of the world's Black-necked Cranes breed on the Zoige Plateau. However, no systematic studies have been conducted on the land cover patterns and habitat suitability of their breeding sites. In this study, the fine remote sensing land cover data from 2000 to 2015 and GIS technology were applied to establish habitat suitability index of Black-necked Cranes. Besides, the spatial autocorrelation analysis, geographical detector model and random forest algorithm were used to analyze and discuss the spatial distribution characteristics of habitat suitability and their main climatic drivers on breeding sites. The main results show the following: 1) Marsh wetlands, the dominant land cover types for Black-necked Cranes breeding, which showed a decreasing trend from 2000 to 2005 and an increasing trend from 2005 to 2015, with mainly converting to grassland; the reverse conversion rate of grassland, marsh wetlands, and water body was greater than the positive conversion rate for all three periods; the landscape pattern of most land types increased in fragmentation and decreased in agglomeration and connectivity from 2000 to 2015. 2) Suitable regions (highly-suitable and sub-suitable) accounted for between 11.62 and 13.84% of the total, with a gradual increase in the area of highly suitable regions over the three periods; the Moran's I indices were all greater than 0.80 from 2000 to 2015, indicating high positive spatial autocorrelation of habitat suitability and significant spatial clustering characteristics. 3) Climate influences the breeding habitat of Black-necked Cranes, with the main factors ranked as follows (power of determinant, PD > 0.165): precipitation from May to September > mean temperature from October to November > minimum temperature in November > annual precipitation > annual mean temperature; the interaction effects of climate factors include mutual and non-linear enhancement, with the largest PD value reaching 0.358 for the interaction between precipitation from May to September and November maximum temperature. The research aims to provide scientific evidence for the safe local breeding of Black-necked Cranes and biodiversity conservation in alpine wetland ecosystems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Biodiversity accounting and reporting are relevant for developing organisational practices oriented towards environmental sustainability, promoting cleaner management policies with less impact on the environment. Biodiversity accounting research has attracted scholars in business management and accounting, and as a result, the literature in the field has grown in recent years. This study analyses the intellectual structure of the biodiversity accounting and management discipline through a systematic literature review, along with bibliometric techniques based on a co-word analysis of the main keywords included in 63 publications. The results reveal five thematic clusters: one motor cluster (sustainability), two transversal clusters (biodiversity reporting, corporate biodiversity management) and two isolated clusters (environmental protection, emancipatory accounting). In addition, the content of the selected papers is analysed and promising research paths are found, such as the need for more robust quantitative analyses or the development of new forms of emancipatory accounting.

	abstract = {Global demand for food, including rising consumption of meat and dairy products, is increasing pressure on the environment and natural resources, often in locations distant from points of consumption. To identify and quantify consumer driven impacts and the components of the supply chain where sustainability interventions will be most effective, spatially explicit consumption-linked indicators that encompass environmental risks are required. Large amounts of phosphorus fertilizers are used in Brazilian soybean cultivation, which potentially cause eutrophication and impact freshwater species. We use a sub-national trade model to develop a spatially explicit approach for assessing commodity-driven phosphorus fertilizer use and its potential impact on biodiversity linked to four key consumers. The use of phosphorus for embedded consumption per capita of Brazilian soybean in China, the EU, the UK, and Sweden are estimated at municipal level and combined with metrics that influence losses of phosphorus to create a normalised relative risk index. The relative risk index is presented in geospatial visualisations to explore geographical patterns of risk to freshwater biodiversity and make the link between consumer and producer countries less obscure. The results indicate high phosphorus-linked species risk in municipalities within Mato Grosso, Rio Grande do Sul, Paraná, and Goiás. Sweden and the UK generate the highest relative risk and the geographical patterns of risk differ between the investigated consuming countries, showing that smaller countries can have relatively large impacts at a spatially explicit scale. In the Amazon biome, risk of nutrient losses and biodiversity are relatively high, creating concerns as soybean production is expanding into the area. The results and methodological approach can contribute to understanding of accountability, agency, and increased transparency for the governance of global supply chains, necessary for enabling transformations towards sustainable food systems. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Stand-alone hybrid renewable energy systems have been proven as a promising pathway towards reliable and sustainable electrification of remote rural off-grid communities. The present study proposes such a system for a location near the Indian part of the Sundarbans, an area rich in biodiversity and endangered species. The hybrid system comprises solar photovoltaic modules, wind turbine, biomass generators with an electrolyzer-fuel cell-based storage system and can potentially replace the current kerosene-based arrangements, which have a significant damaging effect both on the surrounding ecosystem and the health of the residing population. The excess generation from the system is diverted to a reverse osmosis desalination system to meet the fresh water demands of the community. The sizing optimization of the hybrid configurations, performed in the MATLAB environment using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, minimizes the cost of energy ($/kWh) and the damage to human health (DALYs) caused by the system while maintaining a demand supply reliability defined by the loss of power supply probability index. The optimized systems are analyzed based on crucial socio-enviro-economic indicators such as: cost of water ($/m3), lifecycle emission (kg CO2-eq/yr), carbon emission penalty ($/kg), ecosystem damage (species·year), job creation, and human development index. The results indicate that the best configuration has an energy cost of 0.1967 $/kWh with a water cost of 0.86 $/m3. With the least carbon emission of 56,345 kg CO2-eq/yr, 7.89E-2 DALYs of damage to human health, and 4.47E-4 species·year damage to the ecosystem, this system also imparts a positive effect on the community by creating 2.484 jobs and improving the living standards of the people with a human development index value of 0.5885. Moreover, the proposed hybrid system is able to mitigate 75,832 kg/yr of CO2 emissions, preserving the ecological quality of the region. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The current European context, affected by the dramatic conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related energy and food shortages, is putting a strain on the natural gas availability of the European member states. The latter are forced to new negotiations with other potential energy suppliers, to urgent internal measures to reduce energy demand and, at the same time, to fulfil their commitments to internationally agreed climate targets, where the energy transition is a key strategy. A sustainable energy transition strategy is also essential in circular economy implementation (CE), requiring the replacement of fossil energies with renewable ones. In turn, the energy transition should meet the CE principles to reduce the consumption of natural resources and the contribution to climate change. In this context, this study assesses the environmental impacts of the Italian and EU electricity mixes under different governmental and research scenarios and perspectives, by means of the Life Cycle Assessment approach (Midpoint and Endpoint LCA). Results show that the shift from the BAU electricity mix (year 2021) to the emergency Government plan scenario (2021–2023) replacing 14% of Russian natural gas by means of 42% oil and coal and 58% renewables slightly reduces the contribution to Midpoint LCA impact indicators, including global warming and fossil resource scarcity, while still contributing to particulate matter formation, terrestrial acidification, eco-toxicity and water consumption. The contribution to global warming further decreases in the other modelled scenarios, where natural gas is assumed to decrease from 30% to a high 60% in favour of renewables (Governmental plan 2030 scenario). Other impacts, in particular terrestrial and human toxicity, are instead expected to worsen, calling for much needed improvement of renewable technologies. Further, the Endpoint LCA impact indicators, expressed as DALY (human health damage), lost species potential (biodiversity damage) and increased costs for the extraction of mineral and fossil resources, improve in the Governmental Plan 2030 scenario and other modelled options. LCA shows to be a key method for the energy transition, in order to identify hotspots of modelled electricity scenarios and suggest more environmentally, circular and socially just improvement solutions. The adoption of the concept of CE in energy transition entails the expansion of the boundaries of an LCA to include the end-of-life of renewable technologies (so-called “cradle to cradle” approach) and the assessment of the most successful options to mitigate the environmental and social impacts of energy transition. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Low-carbon technologies are needed to mitigate the impacts of climate change but require large amounts of metals, whose mining and processing cause a broad range of other environmental impacts. These require sound assessment to prevent burden-shifting. One assessment approach for that is the Planetary Boundary framework which acts as a guidance system for maintaining the stability of the Earth. This framework is still under development and has so far only been applied in a few several sectors, not including the metal sector. The environmental challenges of the metal sectors are unique, the adaptation potentials of existing work have not been investigated and the specific data and methodology gaps are unclear. Hence, this paper reviews the current knowledge as well as the open research gaps of the critical planetary boundaries (including for example climate change, biodiversity integrity, freshwater use) related to the metals required for low-carbon technologies. To complement that perspective, life cycle assessments stress the relevance of fine particulate matter formation as well as toxicity impacts, with the related planetary boundaries (atmospheric aerosol loading and introduction of novel entities) being the least developed ones. The interplay of different scales of planetary boundaries like on regional or global level will need further assessment. Finally, we consolidate our findings to formulate the research objectives that will complete the mapping of the metal sector onto the Planetary Boundary framework. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Ongoing, rapid urbanization accompanied by habitat fragmentation and loss poses great threats to biodiversity and the ecosystem. Maintaining ecological networks (ENs) connectivity provides a powerful landscape strategy to confront these ecological consequences. However, for rapid urbanization contexts, the connectivity of ENs cannot be well maintained by the current protection system under the impacts of continuous land expansion. Although the stepping-stones protection offers feasible connectivity-based schemes, the degree of their availability in dynamic land expansion scenarios is unclear. In this study, we developed a static and dynamic coupling approach that emphasized a comprehensive ENs protection system should be incorporated into future land expansion scenarios. The system included landscape defects identification which can be built as stepping-stones outside the traditional ENs establishment framework for ENs connectivity restoration. Taking Southern Jiangsu as the application case, our results showed that there were 127 existing landscape defects covering a total area of 285.00 km2, in the fragmented regional ENs, constituting the group of stepping-stones that can efficiently improve the ENs connectivity. Meanwhile, we confirmed that these stepping-stones were vulnerable although they were included in the protection system, with 70% of the total would be degraded and 13% lost due to the encroachments caused by future land expansion. Therefore, we proposed an alternative scenario that designated stepping-stones as restricted land expansion areas integrated into the comprehensive ENs protection system to maintain their persistent roles in connectivity. This study highlighted the weakness of traditional ENs establishment for rapid urbanization contexts and provided practical contributions to improving the effect of regional ecological protection and restoration. © 2022},

	abstract = {Tropical peatland stores a large amount of carbon. In the last 20 years, drainage of Asian peat soil has increased to satisfy the demand of land for plantation agricultures. Industrial oil palm plantations occupy large areas of peatland in Indonesia and Malaysia, with associated GHG emissions and biodiversity loss, here referred to as nature occupation impact. This study performs a detailed Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of 1 kg of palm oil for two case studies: PT SMART's Hanau and Sungai Rungau facilities in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The objective is to quantify the reduction in GHG emissions and nature occupation that has been achieved by implementing the following industry-driven measures: reducing the area of cultivated peat soil, reducing the peat drainage depth, and setting aside part of the land-bank for nature conservation. The results show that 1 kg of palm oil causes 2.72 and 2.25 kg CO2-eq./kg palm oil from Hanau and Sungai Rungau facilities respectively. These are 20%–34% lower than average RSPO certified palm oil and 49%–58% lower than average non-certified palm oil. Sungai Rungau achieves the reduction mainly due to a completely peat soil-free supply base. Hanau's peat emissions are instead 0.28 kg, compared to the 0.77 and 2.36 kg CO2-eq for RSPO certified and non-certified palm oil respectively, due to a very low drainage depth (18–25 cm compared to 57–73 cm in average of RSPO certified and non-certified respectively) and an overall lower share of oil palms on peat land. The impact on nature occupation is 24%–43% lower in Hanau and Sungai Rungau compared to non-certified oil and 4%–29% lower compared to RPSO certified respectively. About 8% of the total land bank of the Hanau supply-base has been set aside for nature conservation, reducing GHG emissions by 2% and nature occupation by 9%. Both Hanau and Sungai Rungau could also significantly reduce GHG emissions in the palm oil milling stage, by implementing biogas capture in palm oil mill effluent (POME) treatment. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Impact investments have the dual goals of generating profit and environmental and/or social impact from the same project or enterprise. This article examines recent impact investments in biodiversity conservation—specifically, debt finance in the form of conventional bonds and impact bonds. The proceeds of these bonds finance projects aiming to enhance forest management, sustainable agriculture, endangered species protection, ecosystem service provision, and nature-based solutions to climate change such as REDD+. The article scrutinises whether these dual goals are achievable by evaluating the financial risks and impact risks within each bond's theory of change. Risks stem from projects with vague cashflow forecasts, project sites with low or ambiguous threat statuses, and simplified impact metrics that may measure activities or outputs—rather than impact. Risk mitigation strategies involve using baselines and counterfactuals to establish additionality, and guarantors to protect investors if revenues are insufficient. Implications for biodiversity management and for-profit conservation are discussed. © 2022 The Author. Business Strategy and The Environment published by ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Minimising environmental impacts and prioritising the production of nutritious foods are essential qualities of a sustainable food system. Ultra-processed foods (UFPs) are potentially counterproductive to these objectives. This review aims to summarise the magnitude and types of environmental impacts resulting from each stage of the UPF supply chain and to develop a conceptual framework to display these impacts. It also aims to identify the terms used to describe UPFs in the sustainability literature, and the methods used to measure the associated environmental impacts. A narrative review approach with a systematic search strategy was used. Fifty-two studies were included that either described or quantified the environmental impacts of UPFs. This review found that UPFs are responsible for significant diet-related environmental impacts. Included studies reported that UPFs accounted for between 17 and 39% of total diet-related energy use, 36–45% of total diet-related biodiversity loss, up to one-third of total diet-related greenhouse gas emissions, land use and food waste and up to one-quarter of total diet-related water-use among adults in a range of high-income countries. These results varied depending on the scope of the term used to describe UPFs, stages of the lifecycle included in the analyses and country. Studies also identified that UPF production and consumption has impacts on land degradation, herbicide use, eutrophication and packaging use, although these impacts were not quantified in relation to dietary contribution. The findings highlight that environmental degradation associated with UPFs is of significant concern due to the substantial resources used in the production and processing of such products, and also because UPFs are superfluous to basic human needs. The conceptual framework and findings presented can be used to inform food policy and dietary guideline development, as well as provide recommendations for future research. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The ecological value of tropical forests in water conservation district has been of great interest because of their rich vegetation types and higher biomass density than any other land cover types, it is urgent to evaluate the ecological value of tropical forests in water conservation district. However, the monitoring of tropical forests in water conservation district is faced with many problems, such as high forest density, complexity and diversity of the forest structure, complex topography and climate conditions, and the difficulty of access for investigators. In order to solve the above difficulties, this study combined 3D point cloud reconstruction based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - Structure from Motion (UAV-SfM) technology with forest type classification based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method, combined with a small amount of forest permanent sample plot survey data, to accurately evaluate the forest biomass distribution and forest biodiversity in water conservation district. The results show that the overall classification accuracy of the 20 forest types in water conservation district based on the CNN method is 0.61, the overall Kappa coefficient is 0.59, and the conditional Kappa coefficient is concentrated in the range of 0.43–0.85. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the plane measurement of UAV-SfM technology is 0.432 m, and the RMSE of the elevation measurement is 0.989 m, the effect of this UAV technology in tropical forest monitoring is superior. Using the techniques mentioned above, this study can effectively and accurately monitor and evaluate the biomass distribution and biodiversity of tropical forests in the water conservation district. Based on the precision forest ecological monitoring data, this study can develop a scientific and reasonable sustainable forest management plan for the water conservation district according to the distribution of forest biomass and biodiversity. The combination of UAV-SfM technology and the CNN method is an innovative attempt, and the integration of UAV and artificial intelligence technology solves practical problems faced by sustainable forest management. UAV and artificial intelligence will also provide an important foundation for forest ecological environment sustainability assessment research. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Methodologically, the research was supported by a case study, that applied documentary research, direct observation and semi-structured interviews with professionals with extensive experience. As main results, it was observed that the risk identification stage pointed out the “bad segregation or contamination of the waste” as the risk with the greatest potential impact on the operations, since in the event of its occurrence, it may compromise a relevant percentage of the company's revenue with co-products from the sale of solid waste, in addition to environmental impacts through the release of a wide variety of polluting products, endangering human health and biodiversity. As a main conclusion, it is observed that the risk management process applied to the reverse logistics of steel residues has the ability to organize proactive actions so that risks are identified, analyzed and evaluated, minimizing their occurrence and promoting risk mitigation actions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The preservation of biodiversity is a rising global concern and will have a major impact on the design and management of buildings and their immediate surroundings. Thus far, the majority of work on biodiversity and the built environment appears to focus on urban planning, project development, and the niche area of designing buildings with living walls and green roofs. Knowledge on the specific interaction between individual buildings and animals is fragmented, preventing holistic efforts to better manage these interactions. This paper presents the findings from a scoping study which captures the state-of-the-art about relationships between individual buildings, building stakeholders, and animals. It reviews the current body of knowledge and points out three areas of interest that are crucial for future work on this area of study: (1) different stakeholder perspectives of building stakeholders on animals in and around buildings (2) positive and negative interactions between individual buildings and their immediate surroundings with animals and (3) management of interactions between animals in and around buildings. Findings show that literature in relation to these three aspects is fragmented and contains multiple gaps in relation to which species need to be considered and how, including a total absence of mathematical models able to represent animal-building interactions. It calls for better engagement between built environment researchers and their counterparts in biological sciences to collect appropriate data and extract relevant information from it, enhancing knowledge on complex biological processes towards producing shared understanding and developing integrated actions. © 2022 The Authors},

Lower ocean pH levels threaten marine ecosystems and especially strongly calcifying species. Impacts on marine ecosystem quality are currently underrepresented in life cycle assessments (LCAs). Here, we developed characterization factors for the life cycle impact assessment of ocean acidification. Our main contribution was developing new species sensitivity distributions (SSDs), from which we derived effect factors for different impact perspectives: Marginal, linear, and average changes for both the past and four future emission scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5). Based on a dataset that covered five taxa (corals, crustaceans, echinoderms, fishes, molluscs) and three climate zones, we showed significantly higher sensitivities for strongly calcifying than slightly calcifying taxa and in polar regions compared to tropical and temperate regions. Experimental duration, leading to acute, subchronic, or chronic toxicological endpoints, did not significantly affect the species sensitivities. With ocean acidification impacts still accelerating, the future-oriented average effects are higher than the marginal or past-oriented average effects. While our characterization factors are ready for use in LCA, we also point to opportunities for improvement in future developments. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Halophiles are key microorganisms to potentially overcome the salinity-induced limitation in anaerobic bioremediation of organic pollutants and energy recovery when using conventional inoculums. This study aimed to enrich halophiles from hypersaline sediment and optimize their use as alternative inoculum for fermentative hydrogen production. Batch assays of 15 combinations (i.e., pH 6–10, salinity of 10–70 g-NaCl/L, and iron concentration of 0.2–1.0 g-FeSO4/L) were conducted using glucose as a substrate. To potentially boost the efficiency via optimization of operational conditions, response surface methodology (RSM) was employed. The maximum obtained hydrogen yield (HY) of 151 mL/g-COD (1.29 mol-H2/mol-glucose) was achieved at pH 6.0, 40 g-NaCL/L, and 0.6 g-FeSO4/L. The results further emphasize the negative impacts of salinity <25 g-NaCl/L and pH > 8, along with the beneficial role of iron supplementation (0.3–1.0 g-FeSO4/L). By using and validating a multivariate optimization model using desirability function, towards maximum HY, the predicted value was 155 mL/g-COD at pH 6.65, 70 g-NaCl/L, and 0.2 g-FeSO4/L. The microbial community analysis revealed that the enrichment of raw sediment enhanced the biodiversity, and then showed that Halobacteroidaceae bacteria were the key players in producing H2 from glucose. Overall, with respect to the achieved competitive HY (1.29 mol/mol-glucose), the use of halophiles-based inoculum is feasible to overcome the limitations of DF when treating saline wastewater, and future studies/implications with real effluents are worthy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Acid rock drainage (ARD), produced from sulfide-bearing mine waste (e.g., waste rock, tailings) at active and abandoned mine sites, continues to be a global concern due to the significant impacts on water, soil, biodiversity, and the creation of public health risks. Many examples demonstrate that it is technically challenging to control and manage ARD, with common methods including costly additive treatments. Instead, an improved approach to ARD management is to minimize opportunities for generation from the outset. In this paper, a new mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is proposed to optimize the placement of waste rock into waste dumps with the objective of minimizing ARD formation. The MIP model considers the net neutralizing potential (NNP) value of waste rocks and decides about the best place for each parcel of mining waste within the waste dump, regarding the target NNP value. Moreover, the waste rocks’ haulage costs obtained from the proposed model were assessed against a recently practiced model (base case). The distribution of NNP value was also simulated in the dump to evaluate neutralizing of the acidity produced by sulfide oxidation in the dump's different parts. Finally, the capability of the model was evaluated in a real case. The results indicate that the safe threshold conditions (e.g. NNP value ≥ target NNP) are satisfied in dump cells, leading to the optimal disposal of waste rocks and ARD prevention. In addition to the neutralizing advantage, applying the proposed model results in preventing the re-handling of waste materials and reduces the haulage costs by 6.8% compared to the base case. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Ecosystems play an essential role in maintaining biodiversity, regulating climate, and promoting functional biodiversity in arid urban agglomerations. Accurately assessing the characteristics of ecosystem services and identifying eco-optimal regions in urban agglomerations in arid regions are important for ecological security and the sustainable development of regional ecological systems. In this study, the ecosystem service functions of Urban Agglomeration on the Northern Slope of the Tianshan Mountains (UANSTM) were evaluated using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model based on the Geographic Information System (GIS) platform coupled with multi-source data. Moreover, the eco-optimal regions were identified by the Ordered Weighted Average (OWA). The findings demonstrate that the development and ecological construction of the UANSTM lead to the conversion of a large amount of unused land to grassland, cultivated land, and construction land. Analyzing the relationship between ecosystem services and land types shows that the high value ecosystem services are mainly distributed in forest land and grassland. In terms of changes in ecosystem services, the net primary productivity (NPP) and habitat quality (HQ) values increased, while the value of soil retention (SR) and water yield (WY) decreased. The relationship between ecosystem services is mainly pairwise synergy, except for HQ-WY and NPP-WY. Regarding spatial distribution, the trade-offs and synergies of ecosystem services demonstrated different geospatial heterogeneity. The OWA model was employed to establish different risk values and weights to simulate different risk scenarios. The area of coverage of risk scenario 5, with the highest trade-off values, was selected as the eco-optimal region. The eco-optimal regions were mainly located in the urban agglomeration's central and southwestern high-altitude areas, where a safety barrier was established for the ecological region. The results of this study can serve as a reference for the ecological construction, land planning, and management of urban agglomerations in arid regions. © 2022},

	abstract = {Despite increasing attention, the quantification of ecosystem services values in life cycle assessment (LCA) remains nascent relative to other impact categories. In this analysis, we develop and implement a novel approach for quantifying both land requirements and ecosystem services values based on The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity framework. Our case study focuses on energy infrastructure in the US portion of the Chihuahuan Desert, a location that has high resource potential for multiple types of energy. The analysis focuses on the land requirements of three types of power plants from a life cycle perspective: natural gas, solar, and wind. The mean land-use intensity for natural gas, solar, and wind electricity is estimated to be 0.27, 0.68, and 0.064 meters squared per Megawatt-hour (m2/MWh), respectively. When considering cumulative land use of the upstream natural gas supply chain, solar breaks even with gas within 10 years. Mean ecosystem services costs are $0.54, $1.39, and $0.12 USD/MWh for electricity generated from natural gas, solar, and wind, respectively. Ecosystem services costs for developments in this region are low relative to levelized costs of electricity (<5%) but are subject to low values compared to other types of ecosystems. Results will vary with regionalized ecosystem services values and different products. Although the results of this study are specific to electricity generation in the Chihuahuan Desert with 2016 as the baseline year, our approach is applicable across regions, scales, and product systems within LCA.

The veracity and timeliness of remote sensing technologies outpaces the surveillance capabilities of existing monitoring and reporting practices in organisations and their supply chains – which are often based on in situ observations and operated through processes that were largely developed in the pre-internet era. This paper provides a conceptual analysis of the impact of remote sensing on conformance systems (also referred to as assurance systems) – an infrastructure that is typical for standards, monitoring and reporting mechanisms such as ISO 14001, the GRI or ESG. The analysis is grounded against a backdrop of the Eco-index (a cross-disciplinary scientific initiative in New Zealand) that develops a surveillance system to monitor biodiversity. The socio-technical perspective is used as the theoretical underpinning. A conceptual analysis demonstrates that conformance systems need to undergo a transformational change. This change is discussed in the paper in terms of the critical socio-technical components (technological, actors, task and structure) that are needed to transform and align with the needs of the digital economy. © 2023},

	abstract = {The transition challenge to sustainability is the governance of common use and property resources the commons. Climate change, as the prime mover of that transition processes, directly affects all sectors of society. Food production, and its relative resources – energy and water - is a relevant sector in the transition to sustainability, since it makes direct use of commons. Food production systems present different configurations and interrelations with the environment; however, they have as a similar character: the complexity regarding the interrelations with commons and with society. This complexity addresses the demand on understanding the dynamics of food, energy and water nexus (FEW Nexus) interrelated dimensions. In this context, this article models FEW Nexus using a System Dynamics Modelling (SDM) approach. The study was developed in the green belt of the peri-urban region of the city of São Paulo, located at the edge of the Atlantic Forest, a high-biodiversity forest in the south-eastern Brazil. The simulation of this complex system aims to support the sustainable governance policy of conventional and agroecological production systems. The innovative pattern of different food sustainable systems could be foresighted, from a set of socioeconomic and environmental multi-criteria ensemble of relevant indicators, as Water Footprint, Trophic State Index, Land Social Development Index, Carbon Footprint, Land Use Earnings. Policy tools, as Community Supported Agriculture strategies and Payment for Environmental Services are used to understand the different levels of sustainability under new innovative policies like them. The SDM tool enabled addressing predictive scenarios - seeing the interrelations and causalities of the set of indicators. The multi-criteria set of indicators modelling permits to understand the FEW Nexus sustainability level of the different food production systems. The results are strong guides to implementing strategies that lead to the dynamics of sustainable food systems, concerning FEW Nexus.

	abstract = {Many studies have analysed the environmental impact of vegan, vegetarian, or reduced meat diets. To date, literature has not evaluated how diet shifts affect environmental impacts by utilising portfolios which reflect personal nutrition preferences. Further, changing diets could alter the available land for non-food uses. This paper defines novel diet portfolios to outline alternative diet transitions and choices within the population and finds their effect on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, primary energy use, and land use in Germany. The aim of this study is to capture how these diet shifts affect land availability and increase the options for land-based climate change mitigation strategies. To do so, a contextualisation is made to compare the use of freed-up land for afforestation or biomethane production (with and without carbon capture and storage). The investigated diet portfolios lead to a reduction of the investigated impacts (GHG emissions: 7–67%; energy use: 5–46%; land use: 6–64%). Additionally, afforestation of freed-up land from each diet portfolio leads to further emission removals of 4–37%. In comparison, using the land to produce energy crops for biomethane production could lead to 2–23% further CO2-eq emission reductions when replacing fossil methane. If biomethane production is paired with carbon capture and storage, emission abatement is increased to 3–34%. This research indicates various short-term pathways to reduce GHG emissions with portfolio diet shifts. Utilising freed-up land for climate change mitigation strategies could prove essential to meet climate targets, but trade-offs with, e.g. biodiversity and ecosystem services exist and should be considered. © 2022 The Authors},

Building on upper echelon and gender socialization theories, we investigate the effect of board gender diversity (BGD) on the biodiversity initiatives undertaken by firms for the restoration and rehabilitation of damaged ecosystems and/or to minimize their environmental impacts. Using data on 2406 US firms covered in the ASSET4 database for the period 2002–2018 (15,337 firm-year observations), we document a significant positive association between BGD and both biodiversity restoration protection and impact reduction initiatives. Our findings are consistent for exploitative and nonexploitative industries, as well as for the pre- and post-UN resolution on conservation of biodiversity periods. We further develop a causal relationship through the positive impact of BGD on management environment training and environmental partnerships—possible mechanisms by which BGD may impact biodiversity initiatives. The results suggest that BGD is vital for developing strategies concerning the restoration, protection and impact reduction of biodiversity and ecosystems. Our findings are of interest to legislators and regulators who are interested in assessing biodiversity initiatives, improving environmental policies and promoting gender diversity in company director boards. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

The research problem considers the relationship between human critical success factors and the adoption of low-carbon management practices. Quantitative analysis through structural equation modeling shows the three branches of hypothesis to be accepted—the first with a higher coefficient than the second and the second with a higher coefficient than the third. It was observed that human factors influence low-carbon product management practices the most, followed by process practices and finally logistics practices. Qualitative multiple-case study research shows that companies are at different stages of maturity in relation to low-carbon management organizational practices, ranging from the highest stage to the lowest.

	abstract = {In-situ sludge reduction is an important process in the biological treatment of dyeing wastewater. In this study, an anaerobic-oxic-settling-anaerobic process (A + OSA) was employed for dyeing wastewater treatment under the condition of sludge return to investigate the efficiency of dyeing wastewater treatment and sludge reduction performance. This was compared with an anaerobic-anaerobic-oxic process (AAO) without sludge return. Results showed that treatment of dyeing wastewater with the A + OSA process gave a 30% reduction in sludge and a 90% decolourisation efficiency, which was more efficient than the AAO process. Interestingly, the effluent chemical oxygen demand from the A + OSA process was higher than that from the AAO process. This was due to the inhibition of microbial activity due to the accumulation of intermediate compounds―aromatic amines―caused by long-term sludge return. Moreover, the returned sludge may have been degraded as a co-metabolism substrate, which resulted in the concentration of extracellular polymeric substances in the A + OSA process was higher than that in the AAO process. Additionally, high-throughput sequencing analysis indicated that sludge reduction performance was correlated with the growth of Saccharibacteria. Furthermore, analysis of the enzyme activity showed that dehydrogenase and catalase content decreased in the A + OSA process. This A + OSA process could be further scaled-up and optimized to serve as a promising and effective technology for the treatment of dyeing wastewater. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Because of the gradient effect of various environmental factors, mountain areas provide favorable conditions for studying the responses of vegetation to global climate change. As a crucial part of the soil-rock mountain area in northern China, the Beijing mountain area is an important ecological barrier to the capital of China. We investigated the main ecological functions of the forest ecosystem in a typical soil-rock mountain area. Taking elevation and slope direction as the spatial quantity, the spatial heterogeneity of the main ecological functions of the forest ecosystem at elevations from 150 to 1,050m were analyzed. The five functions were mostly intercorrelated; the highest correlation was found between water yield and biodiversity. The most important ecological element was soil moisture, and the high content of soil gravel limited water availability. Against the background of climate warming and drying in North China, water yield and diversity may continue to decreased in the near future, further enhancing ecological pressure. Therefore, we suggest that the afforestation density in this area should not exceed 1,500 trees/ha, and the stand structure should be optimized to obtain a canopy closure of less than 0.6, thereby ensuring sustainable forest development. © 2022},

Here we describe the first in-depth investigation of the differences between perceived and actual behaviour in clam harvesting, with a view to determine a more sustainable approach to conserve a previously unprotected tourist and clam-harvesting site, Shui Hau, in Hong Kong. We assessed harvesting pressure by conducting a clam-harvest photographic survey and collected self-reported questionnaires in 2018. More than 90% of visitors per sampling day were assessed for the survey, resulting in 86 sets of completed questionnaires and clam harvest photographs, in which we counted the number of clams harvested and recorded the shell length of each clam. We found that the clam-diggers had high self-reported environmental attitudes and behaviour, and a higher new ecological paradigm score was associated with a better clam-digging related attitude and perceived clam-digging behaviour. The low correlation between self-reported behaviour and actual behaviour indicated that most clam-diggers had different concepts or definitions of the appropriate size of the clam harvest and the size of a mature clam, even though each digger reported that he/she had the highest level of environmental attitudes and behaviour. This differentiation may imply a transition problem between environmental attitudes and actual environmental behaviour. An effective management approach is needed to foster clam-diggers’ sense of biodiversity to embrace the long-term sustainable use of coastal resources. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Insights into subnational environmental impacts and the underlying drivers are scarce, especially from a consumption-based perspective. Here, we quantified greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land-based biodiversity losses associated with final consumption in 162 regions in the European Union in 2010. For this purpose, we developed an environmentally extended multi-regional input–output (MRIO) model with subnational European information on demand, production, and trade structures subdivided into 18 major economic sectors, while accounting for trade outside Europe. We employed subnational data on land use and national data on GHG emissions. Our results revealed within-country differences in per capita GHG and land-based biodiversity footprints up to factors of 3.0 and 3.5, respectively, indicating that national footprints may mask considerable subnational variability. The per capita GHG footprint increased with per capita income and income equality, whereas we did not find such responses for the per capita land-based biodiversity footprint, reflecting that extra income is primarily spent on energy-intensive activities. Yet, we found a shift from the domestic to the foreign part of the biodiversity footprints with rising population density and income. Because our analysis showed that most regions are already net importers of GHG emissions and biodiversity losses, we conclude that it is increasingly important to address the role of trade in national and regional policies on mitigating GHG emissions and averting further biodiversity losses, both within and outside the region itself. To further increase the policy relevance of subnational footprint analyses, we also recommend the compilation of more detailed subnational MRIO databases including harmonized environmental data. © 2020 by Yale University},

We show that a favourable attitude, driven by perceived business relevance and benefit prospects, fosters engagement. Perceived difficulties, such as lacking finances and knowledge, hinder the engagement. Customers, employees and the general public are presently the only stakeholder groups that drive corporate conservation engagement. Nevertheless, the expectation levels of virtually all stakeholders were found to be quite low and as such inadequate for the ecological crisis we face.

Using Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML) regression, we examine a sample of 200 Fortune Global companies over 3 years. Our results indicate significant positive relations between ecologically conscious companies that are accountable for the protection of biodiversity and species extinction and external assurance, environmental performance, partnerships with socially responsible organizations and awards for sustainable activities. Our empirical results appear to be robust in controlling for possible endogeneities.

RAS are eco-friendly, water efficient, highly productive intensive farming system, which are not associated with adverse environmental impacts, such as habitat destruction, water pollution and eutrophication, biotic depletion, ecological effects on biodiversity due to captive fish and exotic species escape, disease outbreaks, and parasite transmission. Moreover, RAS operate in indoor controlled environment, and thus, only minimally affected by climatic factors, including rainfall variation, flood, drought, global warming, cyclone, salinity fluctuation, ocean acidification, and sea level rise. However, energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are the two most stringent limiting factors for RAS. Despite these potentials and promises, RAS have not yet been widely practiced, particularly in developing countries, due to complex and costly system designs. Further research with technological innovations are needed to establish low-cost, energy efficient RAS for intensifying seafood production, reducing GHG emissions, and adaptation to climate change. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Ecosystem services (ESS) change and its response to human activities is critical for enhancing ecosystem management and regional sustainability. This study constructs a theoretical framework of coupled ESS and three modernization (agricultural modernization (AM), industrialization and urbanization) systems, depicts the dynamic changes of ESS and three modernizations in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) from 2000 to 2018, and further analyses the heterogeneity in the response of multiple ESS to different human activities using the Pearson correlation method and bivariate spatial autocorrelation model. (1) AM showed a significant negative impact on ESS and other single ESS except for food production and waste treatment services, and there was also an increasingly significant negative correlation between them in space, indicating that AM did not coordinate the local ecological protection and exerted the strongest destruction and an expanding scope of spatially negative effects on ESS. (2) Industrialization was negatively correlated with ESS as well as all of their associated single ESS to a different extent and was only significantly correlated with regulation services, while it interacted spatially with ESS, changing from presenting a weak negative correlation to presenting a weak positive correlation during 2000–2018, which reveals that industrialization had relatively less pressure on ESS and developed in a more eco-friendly mode. (3) Urbanization exerted a weak negative influence on ESS and most single ESS, whereas urbanization was positively correlated with waste treatment, landscape culture provision and biodiversity maintenance services in 2018, and it showed a significant positive impact of a growing tendency to effect ESS in space, which reveals that urbanization was conducive to reducing the overall disturbance of human activities on ESS. (4) The heterogeneity characteristics of the local spatial correlation patterns between the three modernization levels and ESS as well as their changes during 2000–2018 were investigated and presented obvious differences, and the low-high/high-low areas of the levels and changes for these two constructs should be given enough attention and take corresponding adaptive management measures. This study indicates that there are remarkable heterogeneous effects of different intensities and types of human activities on ESS, which should be understood systematically to coordinate the development pathways and patterns of three modernizations and the restoration and sustainable utilization of ecosystems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Unfortunately, current assessment and decision-making support tools used to establish local sustainability priorities have limited efficacy. Thus, there is a critical need to design decision-making support tools and assessment models that appropriately fit a specific context. Essentially, they must be more effective in directing our investments in sustainability and social responsibility, both of which influence our future global economic growth. The sustainable value mapping and analysis (SVMA) methodology, presented for the first time in this work, is a tool to engage multi-stakeholder groups in a strategic assessment of the social, environmental, and economic priorities and needs within supply chain operations. This paper introduces the SVMA methodology and applies it to two case studies, California almond growing and California winegrowing systems. The results point to the efficacy of the SVMA and opportunities to use it to develop and evaluate localized sustainability performance and outcomes against broader sustainable development goals (SDGs). © 2021},

This process is characterised with an enormous complexity, which policymaking needs to acknowledge for designing transition pathways. Modelling can support policymaking in dealing with uncertainty and complexity. This article reviews emerging and new developments and approaches to model the development of the bioeconomy. We focused our review on how bioeconomy modelling addresses key enabling factors related to (i) climate change, (ii) biodiversity, (iii) circular use of biomass, (iv) consumer behaviour related to biomass and bioproducts use, and (v) innovation and technological change. We find that existing modelling frameworks offer large possibilities for extensions and considerations for analysing short-run impacts related to climate change and circularity, and to lesser degree for biodiversity, and we identify possibilities for developing further the existing bioeconomy models. However, addressing key processes related to societal and technological changes is more challenging with existing/conventional modelling approaches, as they specifically relate to how innovations transform economic structures and how consumers learn and change their preferences and what kind of dynamics are to be expected. We indicate how emerging modelling techniques such as Agent-Based Modelling could improve and complement existing bioeconomy modelling efforts by allowing for the consideration of structural change and, more generally, transformation of the economic metabolism. This modelling approach eclecticism asks for a better description of modelling targets, a sound reflection on the meaning of time horizons and a closer cooperation between the different research communities. Furthermore, it will benefit from the developments in big data and artificial intelligence from which we expect valuable guideposts for designing future modelling strategies. © 2021},

There is a lack of valid measurement attributes to assess sustainable natural rubber development. This study contributes to the literature by providing a set of sustainable natural rubber development attributes and determining a model of their causal interrelationships based on qualitative information. A mixed-method approach comprising the fuzzy Delphi method and the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation technique is used to validate and map the attributes in the model. The findings indicate that technical support has the most significant influence on preventing the economic and social risks involved in natural rubber development. Furthermore, environmental sustainability and economic sustainability interact, and one cannot be achieved without the other. Promoting value addition, natural rubber quality, capital investment, marketing platforms, alternative income sources, attitudes towards change, and material consumption are significant criteria identified as priorities to enhance smallholder producers’ sustainability.

	abstract = {In the light of a circular economy, the Nijhuis Ammonia Recovery system (AECO-NAR) was developed to not only remove nitrogen from wastewater streams, but also produce ammonium sulfate (AS), used as fertilizer, in a single plant. The goal of this paper was to quantify the environmental impacts of side stream ammonia recovery with the AECO-NAR system and compares them with the impacts of side stream nitrogen removal combined SHARON (partly nitrification)-anammox plant. For this, an environmental life cycle assessment was performed with a functional unit (FU) of the treatment of 1 kg of total dissolved nitrogen inflow. Since AS obtained by the AECO-NAR is a by-product of the ammonia removal process, allocation was based on system expansion. Foreground inventory data were obtained from a full-scale plant. ReCiPe2016 was used to determine human health and biodiversity impacts. Results show that due to the production of AS in an integrated water treatment and production system, the AECO-NAR avoids impacts of current AS production, leading to negative impact scores. Impacts per FU decrease with increasing inflow concentrations of ammonia. Main improvement options are the use of renewable energy and the replacement of the cleaning chemical citric acid with a sustainable alternative. Total impacts of the AECO-NAR system diminish when comparing the system to the biological SHARON-Anammox system, due to production of AS fertilizer product. Due to the fertilizer production step being integrated in the side stream treatment, the complete system is beneficial over ammonia recovery and wastewater treatment as separate systems. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {Livestock production, particularly beef supply chain, is charged as the major contributor to green-house gas (GHG) emissions, as well as, in land degradation and deforestation. Environmental impacts per kg of edible beef, however, vary largely due to differences in beef production systems. Thus, this study aimed to compare the cradle-to-farm gate sustainability of four different Italian beef production systems, in terms of land occupation (LO, m2year), global warming (GWP, kg CO2 -eq), water depletion (WD, m3), acidification (AP, g SO2 -eq) and eutrophication (EP, g NO3 -eq) potentials by using the LCA methodology (SimaPro 8.01 PhD, PRé Consultants). The primary data were obtained from 25 farms: 7 farms conducting cow–calf operations, with specialized beef cattle maintained on pasture and finished in confinement, (Specialized extensive, SE); 6 farms conducting high grain fattening of specialized beef breed imported calves (Fattening systems, FS); 5 farms conducting cow-calf operations, with specialized beef animals constantly kept in confinement (Cow-calf intensive; CCI); 7 farms conducting cow–calf operations, with Podolian cattle (a native breed of Southern Italy) maintained on pasture and finished in confinement, (Podolian system; PoS). The functional unit was 1 kg of live weight of marketed beef cattle. Intensive systems (i.e. CCI and FS) showed lower GWP values than systems partially based on pasture such as PoS, and even SE (17.62 ± 1.78 and 21.94 ± 1.95 kg CO2 –eq vs 26.30 ± 1.65 and 25.41 ± 1.65 kg CO2 –eq, P < 0.01, for FS, CCI, SE, and PoS, respectively). No significant effect of production system on WD was observed. Acidification potential was significantly (P < 0.001) affected by production system with the highest values observed in CCI (0.30 ± 0.02 kg SO2 –eq) compared with the other three beef production systems. As for eutrophication potential, FS and PoS tended to show lower values compared with CCI and SE systems (961.71 ± 65.30 and 779.17 ± 70.53 g NO3 -eq vs 1009.20 ± 77.27 and 1009.71 ± 65.30 g NO3 –eq, respectively; P < 0.10). Significant differences (P < 0.001) were observed for LO between the four systems (177.71 ± 20.87 and 194.43 ± 20.87 m2/year vs 40.67 ± 22.54 and 32.60 ± 23.69 m2/year, for PoS and SE vs FS and CCI, respectively). However, as diets in intensive meat systems are mainly based on cereals products that humans could consume directly, the degree of competition with human nutrition should be another feature to be considered. About this aspect, although human edible protein conversion efficiency (HEPCE) was not significantly influenced by production system, PoS showed a higher HEPCE index (0.44 ± 0.08), particularly if compared with CCI system (0.17 ± 0.09), but also in comparison with groups FS and SE (0.34 ± 0.08 and 0.39 ± 0.08, respectively). In addition, grass-based systems may provide other non-commodity outputs and non-marketable public goods services named “ecosystem services” (e.g. provision of clean drinking water, preservation and enhancement of biodiversity, conservation of cultural landscapes, contribution to the socio-economic viability of many rural areas particularly in marginal areas, enhancement of meat quality and animal welfare as perceived by consumers). The present results showed a lower impact of the intensive beef production systems in terms of GWP and LO, whereas some of them were more impactful at AP and EP levels. However, in order to achieve a more accurate estimation of the impact of the beef production chain, particularly for traditional and extensive farming systems conducted in marginal areas, such as the Podolian system, further LCA studies are needed, taking into account the allocation of their ecosystem services. © 2017},

	abstract = {Algae (especially microalgae and cyanobacteria) are potentially diverse, ubiquitous, and dominant group of photosynthetic organisms in nature. The dominance and diversity of algae are commonly observed in small puddles, streams, river, to oceans and even in extreme habitats like cold springs to hot deserts, which makes them a prominent organism for various applications. The past decade has evidenced microalgal research in bioenergy production and other vital biomolecules with wide industrial applications. Further, the easy availability of microalgae and cyanobacteria makes them a suitable candidate for various biotechnological applications like food, feed, fodder, and fuel. Algae are grouped under the third generation biofuel feedstock offering numerous environmental benefits viz., efficient land usage, CO2 sequestration and utilization and most importantly resolving the food vs fuel feud. With this perspective, this review article aims to unravel the conventional and novel applications of microalgal and cyanobacterial biomass in various enterprises and also the recent trends in their exploitation. To understand the overall potential of microalgae, at inception, this review article has articulated a detailed account of the applicability of various algal biomasses for different biofuels such as bioethanol, biodiesel, and biohydrogen. As an environmental benefit, bioremediation of wastewater or nutrient removal from municipal and industrial sources, and pesticide removal using several microalgal strains has been critically appraised and presented comprehensively. Also, the enormous biodiversity and difference in the biochemical composition of microalgae make them stand as a promising source for biologically active compounds with high commercial value. In addition to energy products from algae, converting the biomasses into various industrially important co-products or high value products is an economically sound approach. At this juncture, extraction of secondary metabolites, carotenoids, phycobiliproteins, phytosterols and phenolic compounds from numerous microalgae and cyanobacteria has been discussed in detail. Overall, the present review gives a detailed account of the biofuel production from algae, bioproducts extraction, environmental applications of microalgae, and cyanobacteria for bioremediation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The forest-based sector is affected by many profound structural changes and the increasing complexity of the business environment due to, for example, the mature markets of many core products and the aims for bio and circular economies and more sustainable societies. In response to the changing business environment, forest-based sector firms need to restructure their business models and develop new products and services. From the Finnish perspective, new forest-based businesses are crucial in the transition to successful and sustainable bio and circular economies. Views on the concepts of bioeconomy, circular economy and sustainability vary according to which parties are involved. Developing new forest-based sector businesses requires that different actors have knowledge of how each understands these concepts because this creates a basis for commonly accepted goals. This study aims to shed light on how forest-based sector companies understand the concepts of bioeconomy and circular and their linkages to sustainability when transforming their businesses. Semi-structured thematic interviews were conducted with 18 company executives and managers from 17 forest-based sector firms and companies from interfacing sectors, all of which have operations in Finland. The results indicate that there are various understandings of the studied concepts and that they are strongly interlinked. The participating firms often saw themselves as forerunners of circular bioeconomy, highlighting the core role of sustainability and reliance on “reasonable use of wood” and far-reaching, in-depth Finnish expertise in the field. Bioeconomy was usually seen as a response to climate challenge by bio-based, renewable material. The key dichotomy was whether bioeconomy should include traditional, bulk forest-based products or should it be dedicated to new, innovative, higher value-added products only. Another challenge was how to target and guarantee the availability of wood-based biomass for different purposes. Circular economy was characterized by resource efficiency, closed loops, recycling and collaboration. The challenges here was leaning too much on old practices whereas more emphasis should be put on inventing innovative collaborations and products. The sustainability discussion was focused on raw material sustainability and on the importance of Finnish forests as carbon sequesters and the sustainable volumes of wood-biomass utilized, whereas biodiversity went largely unnoticed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper aims to provide a new analytical framework for conflicts of interest between such measures. The framework is applied to climate change and biodiversity (including ecosystem) conservation law as well as thereon based measures and tested on the example of a city embedded in different geopolitical governance levels. The analysis is based on an in-depth literature review and develops an analytical framework in particular grounded upon differentiations between actions and inactions as well as between voluntary and compulsory activities. When testing this framework for the Viennese case, the authors systematically discuss the different types of Viennese endangered habitat types especially according to their required legal and other governance interventions, particularly under the climate change related forest law regime and biodiversity conservation law (both especially against the background of the Natura 2000 scheme of the European Union). The paper explains the logic and structure of the new framework and describes its theoretical applicability on conflicts of interests in general. Furthermore, the case study tested on the city of Vienna/Austria indicates also the practical applicability of the framework and offers different solution approaches de lege lata (how the law is) and de lege ferenda (how the law should be). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The World Economic Forum has identified biodiversity loss as an increasingly significant and impactful risk facing business. However, businesses themselves can negatively impact on biodiversity. Recognizing this, a number of companies have developed their own biodiversity commitments, including those to achieve a no net loss (NNL) or net positive impact (NPI) on biodiversity by balancing or outweighing any negative impacts through mitigation activities. We reviewed corporate-level NNL and NPI commitments over the last two decades to establish the extent of their adoption, retraction, and scientific foundation. Between 2001 and 2016, 66 companies had made NNL/NPI environmental commitments. Thirty three of these 66 companies made specific biodiversity commitments. The numbers of companies making commitments increased in that period. However, some commitments were retracted, or their status became unclear, leaving only 18 companies with active NNL/NPI biodiversity commitments in 2016. Added to this, many of the commitments are lacking science-based criteria that would allow more transparent and systematic assessment of corporate activities. Thus, although commitments are being made, they may not be delivering as intended. To secure real biodiversity gains, we recommend advancing methods to assess biodiversity risks to businesses, and using science-based criteria to deepen corporate commitments and actions. Concerted effort from all sectors is needed to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, and the “biodiversity policy super-year” of 2020 is the perfect moment for business to deliver through well-framed and implemented commitments to biodiversity NPI. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {The agricultural sector accounts for 70% of all water consumption and poses great pressure on ground water resources. Therefore, evaluating agricultural water consumption is highly important as it allows supply chain actors to identify practices which are associated with unsustainable water use, which risk depleting current water resources and impacting future production. However, these assessments are often not feasible for crop producers as data, models and experiments are required in order to conduct them. This work introduces a new on-line agricultural water use assessment tool that provides the water footprint and irrigation requirements at field scale based on an enhanced FAO56 approach combined with a global climate, crop and soil databases. This has been included in the Cool Farm Tool – an online tool which already provides metrics for greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity impacts and therefore allows for a more holistic assessment of environmental sustainability in farming and agricultural supply chains. The model is tested against field scale and state level water footprint data providing good results. The tool provides a practical, reliable way to assess agricultural water use, and offers a means to engage growers and stakeholders in identifying efficient water management practices. © 2018 The Authors},

	abstract = {Cellulosic biofuels produced from energy crops offer significant advantages over first generation biofuels. In order to understand and predict the sustainability performance of cellulosic biofuel development, this study builds a system dynamics model for a biofuel system producing cellulosic ethanol from switchgrass under different scenarios. The model can simulate the dynamic behaviors of the cellulosic biofuel system and quantify its environmental, economic, and social impacts. The projected results indicate that cellulosic ethanol production is economically viable based on advanced bioconversion technologies and can provide significant benefits to the environment, such as greenhouse gas reductions and water use savings. The cellulosic ethanol industry also can make significant contributions to the bioeconomy and social benefits. This study finds that the target of cellulosic biofuels (16 billion gallons by 2022) mandated by the revised Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) program cannot be achieved within land-use change constraints, but may be achieved if there is no limitation on the conversion of pasture or cropland to energy crop land. Moreover, nitrate leaching and biodiversity change should be considered when expanding energy crops on marginal land, pasture, and cropland. This model is applicable for other complex bioenergy systems as a sustainability assessment tool and can provide comprehensive insights for stakeholders and policy makers to establish and implement favorable strategies for stimulating cellulosic biofuel development. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The international industrial ecology (IE) research community and United Nations (UN) Environment have, for the first time, agreed on an authoritative and comprehensive data set for global material extraction and trade covering 40 years of global economic activity and natural resource use. This new data set is becoming the standard information source for decision making at the UN in the context of the post-2015 development agenda, which acknowledges the strong links between sustainable natural resource management, economic prosperity, and human well-being. Only if economic growth and human development can become substantially decoupled from accelerating material use, waste, and emissions can the tensions inherent in the Sustainable Development Goals be resolved and inclusive human development be achieved. In this paper, we summarize the key findings of the assessment study to make the IE research community aware of this new global research resource. The global results show a massive increase in materials extraction from 22 billion tonnes (Bt) in 1970 to 70 Bt in 2010, and an acceleration in material extraction since 2000. This acceleration has occurred at a time when global population growth has slowed and global economic growth has stalled. The global surge in material extraction has been driven by growing wealth and consumption and accelerating trade. A material footprint perspective shows that demand for materials has grown even in the wealthiest parts of the world. Low-income countries have benefited least from growing global resource availability and have continued to deliver primary materials to high-income countries while experiencing few improvements in their domestic material living standards. Material efficiency, the amount of primary materials required per unit of economic activity, has declined since around 2000 because of a shift of global production from very material-efficient economies to less-efficient ones. This global trend of recoupling economic activity with material use, driven by industrialization and urbanization in the global South, most notably Asia, has negative impacts on a suite of environmental and social issues, including natural resource depletion, climate change, loss of biodiversity, and uneven economic development. This research is a good example of the IE research community providing information for evidence-based policy making on the global stage and testament to the growing importance of IE research in achieving global sustainable development. © 2017 by Yale University.},

	abstract = {A number of developing countries have undertaken measures to diversify into renewable electricity generation. Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) is one of the technologies, though despite the high capital costs have numerous technological capabilities. CSP however is a new technology in many developing countries, where the external costs have not been fully understood. Thus far, South Africa has not conducted any detailed externalities assessments for renewable electricity sources. The presented research aims to evaluate the external cost associated with a solar CSP plant using life cycle analysis. The analysis uses a parabolic trough CSP plant with 100 MW capacity located in the Northern Cape region in South Africa. The analysis evaluated external impacts and costs for climate change, human health, loss of biodiversity, local effects on crops, and damage to materials. The study found that climate change accounted for an estimated 32.2 g CO2 eq/kWh of electricity generated. A number of non-greenhouse gas impacts were also analysed of which the effect on human health was the most significant category (0.214 g/kWh). The damage cost quantified in the study for the solar CSP plant was in the range of 2.10–3.31 ZA c/kWh (1.4–2.2 €/MWh) with a central estimate of 2.83 ZA c/kWh (1.9 €/MWh). The results suggested that climate change and human health had a combined contribution of 91% to the central estimate of the external costs which was mostly attributed by the manufacturing life cycle phase. The analysis showed that manufacturing activities have a major contribution across all impact categories. A major policy understanding is that the overall damage costs can be reduced if manufacturing the main components can be localised, to reduce the emissions caused by the transport systems. This could bring added benefits for local communities and industries. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

This situation is significant in urban fringe areas wherein rural areas transition to urban spaces. Therefore, it is important to understand how to scientifically and rationally construct green space ecological networks, connect fragmented habitats, and protect biodiversity and regional ecological security. Here, we used geographic information system and remote sensing technology to address the ecological sources via morphological spatial pattern analysis and ecological connectivity index analysis methods. The minimum cost distance method was used to generate a potential corridor. The green space ecological network system of the study area was constructed based on its green space landscape pattern. Qualitative and quantitative analysis provided targeted recommendations for green space ecological network optimization in the study area. The results showed that in the study area, the level of the fragmentation was high. Although the number of urban green space patches was significant, the area of the patches was small. Despite the potential corridor not covering the study area evenly, the optimized green space corridor increased the secondary ecological source area. The network system for green space corridors comprised water corridors, road corridors, and ecological restoration sites. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

This has led to the emergence of the cropland footprint as a sustainability indicator that links the production and consumption of goods and services to cropland demand. However, croplands are heterogeneous in productivity and in local environmental context. Using a 1.1 km2 spatial resolution map of agricultural production, three cropland footprint indicators were quantified using life cycle impact assessment models for 34 agricultural commodities grown or imported in Australia: cropland scarcity footprint, cropland malnutrition footprint and cropland biodiversity footprint. Although the different cropland footprint results were positively correlated with each other and with a simple assessment of cropland occupation, the relative assessment of different commodities varied substantially. At the scale of the national food system, cropland occupation explained only one third of the variation between commodities in cropland biodiversity footprint. As such, cropland occupation is not a fit-for-purpose indicator to inform about environmental performance. Cropland footprints that address specific environmental concerns using impact assessment models are recommended. These findings have important implications for strategic action to address the environmental challenges related to cropland use, and the development of sustainable diets. © 2020},

Yield and solubility diagrams were obtained with the solid-liquid equilibrium data. When comparing in the same temperature and water content, the alcoholic phase (AP) from liquid-liquid equilibrium with the liquid phase (LP) from solid-liquid equilibrium, it was observed that the oil content in the alcoholic phase (AP) was always higher than that in the liquid phase (LP). This fact reinforces that the miscella oil concentration is influenced by the oil retention in the solid phase (SP).

	abstract = {Industrial symbiosis (IS) employs a cross-organizational perspective to seek synergistic pairings of one company's waste output to another company's input, enabled by interfirm cooperation through resource and information sharing. Orchestrating IS relationships among companies, however, remains a complex process. In the literature, a wide range of qualitative and quantitative tools have emerged, tackling issues ranging from identifying IS creation opportunities to performance evaluation. Thus far, the available literature has focused on separate aspects and perspective of IS creation. Each individual work contributes, in part, to the overall process of IS creation. The disparate perspectives provided by the literature reflect the fragmented nature of available tools supporting IS, which operate in isolation of each other. An encompassing view of tools supporting the process of IS creation is missing to date. Therefore, to fill this gap, this study aims to develop a more comprehensive description of the landscape of IS tools by analyzing the associated approaches, roles, and contribution of existing tools. Through this understanding, the insights gained can be used to aid future development and advancement of tools for IS practitioners. © 2019 by Yale University},

	abstract = {Methodology is developed for linking the urban metabolism (UM) to global environmental stresses on the carbon (C) cycle, nitrogen (N) cycle, and biodiversity loss. UM variables are systematically mapped to the drivers of carbon, nitrogen, and biodiversity impacts. Change in mean species abundance is used as metric of biodiversity loss, by adopting the dose-response relationships from the GLOBIO model. The main biodiversity drivers related to UM included here are land-use change (LUC) and atmospheric N deposition. The methodology is demonstrated by studying the nexus for Shanghai in 2006, based on energy and soybean consumption. Results for Shanghai show a strong nexus between C, N, and biodiversity impact due to electricity consumption and energy used in manufacturing industries and construction. Prioritization of the shift away from coal energy will therefore lead to lowering the urban growth impact on all three dimensions. Road transportation, domestic aviation, and the metal industry impact only the C footprint highly, whereas district energy impacts only biodiversity loss highly, showing a weak nexus. Among the global impacts of soybean consumption in Shanghai on biodiversity loss (due to LUC only), the highest impact occurs in Uruguay (0.52%) followed by Brazil (0.05%) and Argentina (0.02%). The local impact on biodiversity loss (i.e., within China) of soybean consumption in Shanghai is 1.03%. However, the methodology and results are limited due to the partial inclusion of drivers, a carbon footprint based on carbon dioxide emissions only, and limitations of biodiversity loss models. Potential to overcome methodological limitations is discussed. © 2017 by Yale University.},

Inventory analysis of fauna and flora before, during and after crop production was also performed. Carbon and water footprinting were based on the ISO methods, whereas the Swiss Agricultural LCA method was used for biodiversity impact assessment. The results revealed that the impact on climate change was 2.88 kgCO2eq per kg of paddy rice. The calculation of impact on water use with consideration of the water stress index of Mun watershed was 1.34 m3H2Oeq.

	abstract = {Ambient ozone (O3) poses great damage to human health, biodiversity, and climate change. Although the health risk due to O3 pollution has been widely evaluated, the spatiotemporal variation of O3 level and its potential health impact in a remote tropical island was less concerned. In the present study, we firstly employed an efficient machine learning model named random forest (RF) to fill the missing O3 column amount over Hainan Island of China based on the meteorological factors and other geographical covariates. The result suggested that the RF model achieved the best performance (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 6.36 DU) among all of the filling methods. We further used an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to estimate the surface O3 level around Hainan Island on the basis of the full-coverage O3 column amount and other predictors. The XGBoost method showed the better predictive performance (R2 = 0.59, RMSE = 24.14 μg/m3) compared with other estimation models. The predicted O3 concentration exhibited remarkably spatial difference with the highest value observed in Dongfang (77.61 ± 5.25 μg/m3), followed by that in Changjiang (72.51 ± 5.22 μg/m3), and the lowest one in Lingshui (64.16 ± 2.71 μg/m3). Based on the estimated O3 level, we found that the annually mean nonattainment days in Dongfang reached 29.26 ± 35.20 days and about one third of days in the winter fell into the severe O3 pollution over Hainan Island. Besides, the mean all-cause mortalities owing to severe O3 pollution over Hainan Island were calculated to be 391 (95%CI: (212–570)) cases each year, accounting for 0.004% of all the population in Hainan Island. The statistical simulation of O3 level at a remote island updated the traditional knowledge and aroused the public concern on island air pollution. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Anthropization of natural areas accelerated biodiversity loss and climate changes. Thus, it is imperative that all economic sectors adjust to sustainability precepts, collaborating to the maintenance of ecosystems. Therefore, we questioned: Are sustainable companies developing sufficient actions to preserve and/or conserve biomes where they are installed? To answer, we estimated the biodiversity impacts on the Brazilian biomes developed by 11 companies which's participated, uninterruptedly, in all ISE portfolios between 2005 and 2014. We used the LIFE certification methodology (Lasting Initiative for Earth) to qualify and quantify the minimum externalities, and mitigations of each corporation. Ten corporations generated 96% of total externalities, while mitigated only 10%. One financial institution did not develop mitigations, and one company of chemical/petrochemical sector described biodiversity in Brazil as irrelevant and insignificant. Only company of paper/cellulose mitigated their externalities. This company developed 77% of total scores calculated, by creating 41,600 ha of Protected Areas. Thus, the forest sector mitigated 30% of total externalities calculated for the 11 companies. That is, the organizations analyzed here demonstrated that they do not yet internalize the importance of promoting biodiversity conservation actions as a way to minimize their impacts. The LIFE certification methodology can be considered an additional tool for environmental management, indicating areas in which a company has the potential to improve management through the calculus of partial results of externalities. Also, the methodology allows for the strengthening of transparency of sustainability of companies on the Brazilian Stock Exchange (B3) and society as a whole, once the mitigation of environmental impacts through biodiversity conservation actions contributes to promoting the resilience and resistance of ecosystems, allowing the maintenance of ecosystem services, generating social welfare, economic consciousness and environmental equilibrium. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Scholars and practitioners across fields increasingly recognize that business models for the circular economy may be an effective lever for solving ecological persistent problems such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and growing natural resource scarcity. Despite a growing interest in the potential of circular business models, interconnections between the organizational dimensions of firms and their business model innovation processes remain underexplored. Based on problem-centered expert interviews with business consultants experienced in circular business development, this study creates a conceptual model that offers structured knowledge about why firms steadily reproduce linear BMs and how incumbents manifest themselves as a constant linear-oriented value creation system. The model also demonstrates organizational conditions and management strategies that frustrate the reproduction of linear BMs and, thus, enable initial moves towards CBM innovation. Building on this, the article provides a set of propositions on how an organizational transition management may be configured and what incumbents require to successfully navigate circular business model innovation. The findings provide a foundation for a contemporary understanding of circular business model transition management, which simultaneously serve as impulses for future research investigations. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {The chocolate market is experiencing a wave of market differentiation thanks to the emergence of the bean-to-bar movement. Cacao is seeing both a rise in demand for mass markets and a process of market bifurcation into more specialized, high-quality products for wealthy urban consumers. For the specialized market, the quality and origin of the beans are important attributes. Direct trading between chocolate makers and famers seeks to promote the conservation of rare cultivars and traditional agroforestry systems, while lifting farmers out of poverty. Here we assess whether these alternative configurations of the global value chain truly offer smallholders new opportunities, beyond the traditional intensification or marginalization pathways that are generally offered to them. We conducted detailed socio-economic and biophysical surveys with a sample of farms in three of the largest cacao producing provinces of Ecuador. Our results show that, even though smallholders lack the assets needed to join mainstream commodity markets, they have been able to capitalize on the qualities of their traditional varieties to access niche markets. Through strong cooperatives, the knowledge held by buyers about what constitutes a high-quality bean has been transferred to farmers. A unique natural capital may provide smallholders with rewarding pathways to develop their agriculture, exploiting new market opportunities offered by globalization.

Despite the fact that extensive studies exploring topics related to palm oil land use, climate change, and deforestation, little is known regarding the international public's perceptions of palm oil's impacts on environmental issues. The objective of this study is to identify trends and patterns and categorize relevant themes of public opinions in this regard. With a large dataset of 4260 online posts gleaned from YouTube and Reddit, we apply the Institutional theory and social movements to analyze palm oil discussions in the social media context. Our major findings are: (1) the public has negative views on palm oil. Several drivers of environmental destruction are greed, corruption, profit, and capitalism; (2) social media campaigns against palm oil are highly successful. However, negative sentiments from consumers reveal ongoing institutional failures; (3) public opinion is polarized in terms of viewpoints on socioeconomics and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil; (4) global consumers’ response to boycott palm oil products and seek for other solutions are driven by corporations’ profit-driven malpractice and weak governmental legislation and governance. This study is the first attempt to apply big data of social media accounts to analyze consumers’ perceptions of palm oil and its environmental impacts. It also proposes a predictive model for understanding factors and mechanisms of how social media applications can potentially stimulate and influence an international sustainability debate over palm oil. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Estimates of soil carbon changes, biodiversity and ecotoxicity have often been missing from life cycle assessment based studies of organic dairy products, despite evidence that the impacts of organic and conventional management may differ greatly within these areas. The aim of the present work was therefore to investigate the magnitude of including these impact categories within a comprehensive environmental impact assessment of organic and conventional dairy systems differing in basic production conditions. Three basic systems representative of a range of European approaches to dairy production were selected for the analysis, i.e. (i) low-land mixed crop-livestock systems, (ii) lowland grassland-based systems, (iii) and mountainous systems. As in previous publications, this study showed that when assessing climate change, eutrophication and acidification impact organic milk has similar or slightly lower impact than conventional, although land-use is higher under organic management. Including soil carbon changes reduced the global warming potential by 5–18%, mostly in organic systems with a high share of grass in the ration. The impacts of organic milk production on freshwater ecotoxicity, biodiversity and resource depletion were 2, 33 and 20% of the impacts of conventional management, respectively, across the basic systems considered. The study highlights the importance of including biodiversity, ecotoxicity and soil carbon changes in life cycle assessments when comparing organic and conventional agricultural products. Furthermore, the study shows that including more grass in the ration of dairy cows increases soil carbon sequestration and decreases the negative impact on biodiversity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The integration of urban green spaces into modern city planning is seen as a promising tool to offset the drawbacks of ever-expanding cities. Urban agriculture is a common method to implement such strategies and to increase urban sustainability with a special focus on food security. Due to their location, urban farms are highly influenced by past and present anthropogenic activities which can threaten both soil health and food safety. This study includes 12 urban agriculture sites in the metropolitan area of Adelaide, Australia. It is the first of its kind to focus on soil health in urban agriculture systems with a further emphasis on mycorrhizal fungi. Descriptive information about each site, the biodiversity of the selected plots and soil samples from different depths and locations were collected and analysed for chemical and biological parameters. Seven metals, total and plant-available (Colwell) phosphorus and available nitrogen were measured in soils. A glasshouse bioassay was also conducted to determine the abundance of beneficial arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the soils and the change of root colonization after inoculation with the mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. Results showed a generally high biodiversity of plants that correlated with site activity (commercial or community garden) and which could potentially be used for urban biodiversity conservation. Metal concentrations in soils were below national guidelines levels for all samples, although sites with previous industrial history showed elevated levels when compared to sites without industrial history. The use of raised beds with introduced soils eliminated differences in previous land-use history, thereby providing a good option to support cleaner production. Gardening soils were considered highly fertile, with plant-available (Colwell) P concentrations exceeding recommended levels for most horticultural crops, while soils were adequately supplied with nitrogen. Most plant nutrients were derived from freely available urban waste streams and integrated via composting. Various urban waste streams could be used to counter-act imbalanced soil nutrients. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were present in all sites, indicating that the practiced soil management is sustainable from a microbial perspective. Given their important role in supporting plant nutrition, and potential to reduce the need for external nutrient inputs, they provide an important focal point for achieving clean and sustainable urban food production. The results were incorporated into a framework for the management of urban soil health. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

While the ecosystem services narrative is being forwarded globally as a key paradigm for promoting business sustainability, there is scarce knowledge of how these issues are considered at managerial level. This study thus investigates managerial views of corporate sustainability after the ecosystem services concept. We analyse interviews conducted with 20 managers from domestic and international forestry companies operating with a plantation-based business model in China. Content analysis was employed to analyse the data, with a focus on four key areas: (1) interviewee familiarity with the ecosystem services concept; (2) their views of corporate dependencies and impacts on ecosystem services; (3) related business risks and opportunities; and (4) viability of existing instruments and practices that can be employed in detecting and addressing business impacts and dependencies on ecosystem services. Through an inductive approach to the empirical findings, we refined a framework that holds operational value for developing company response strategies to ecosystem services impact/dependence assessment, ensuring that all issues are addressed comprehensively, and that related risks and opportunities are properly acknowledged. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {As one of the most important international rivers in Asia, the Mekong River is famous for its abundant water and hydropower resources, fascinating biodiversity, and geopolitical importance. However, the rapid hydropower development in the Mekong River Basin has induced ecological risks and triggered water conflicts among six riparian nations. Balancing the competing interests of water, energy and ecosystems in the Mekong River Basin is a great challenge for riparian nations and is of global concern. This study quantitatively investigates what role the operation of the cascade reservoirs in China may play in mitigating existing conflicts and achieving cobenefits in the entire Mekong River Basin. An integrated modeling approach is adopted, and simulation-optimization analyses are performed to explore the tradeoff and/or synergy effects among the competing interests under varying reservoir operation strategies. The study reveals the disparate interactions among water, energy and ecosystem sectors and identifies the transboundary cobenefits of hydropower production and water supply. The major study findings are as follows. First, hydropower development in the upper Mekong River (also known as the Lancang River) can be beneficial for downstream agricultural water supply in certain circumstances if the cascade reservoirs in China are operated wisely. Second, the natural flow index adequately reflects ecological concerns in general, but additional objectives need to be included in the optimization if specific interests (e.g., phosphorous export from the Lancang River) are prioritized. Third, the tradeoffs between the agricultural water supply and ecosystem conservation, the two critical concerns of downstream countries, are intrinsic in the lower Mekong River Basin and are not induced by hydropower production in China. Fourth, the agricultural water supply in the downstream countries calls for a larger shift in the flow regime than hydropower production in China. Overall, the results of this study provide new insights into holistic management and effective transboundary cooperation in the Mekong River Basin, as well as in other international river basins with similar water-energy-ecosystem nexuses. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This research focuses on the selection of the optimum process parameters for Aegel marmelos (AM) pyrolysis experiment based on multi-objective decision-making techniques. This investigation presents the optimization report for obtaining maximum pyrolysis oil from AM de-oiled seed cake through thermochemical conversion (pyrolysis) process. The pyrolysis process has been conducted according to L27 orthogonal array with chosen input control factors such as pyrolysis temperature (°C), heating rate (°C/min) and biomass particle size (mm). The output response parameters measured are the bio-oil yield, bio-char yield and biogas yield. The multi-objective decision-making approach namely Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and Grey relational analysis (GRA) techniques are employed to determine the optimum pyrolysis process parameters to maximize the yield of AM bio-oil. The optimized values of pyrolysis temperature (PT), heating rate (HR) and feedstock particle size (PS) are 600 °C, 10 °C/min and 0.6 mm. At peak engine loading condition, 20% AM bio-oil + 80% diesel fuel blend (AM20) emit lower carbon dioxide (CO2 = 8.68%) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx = 1401 ppm) emissions as compared with diesel (D) CO2 (10.33%) and NOx (1511 ppm) emissions. The association between exhaust gas temperature and NOx emission was inferred using a novel approach of thermal imager by sensing the infrared rays from the hot surface of the exhaust port. Infrared thermal images are captured during the engine operations fuelled with bio-oil at the optimum pyrolysis conditions concluded by TOPSIS and GRA results (PT = 600 °C, HR = 10 °C/min and PS = 0.6 mm). According to the thermal imaging result, AM20 blend produces the lower amount of NOx emissions compared with neat diesel and it is suggested that AM bio-oil can be used as engine fuel instead in order to preserve the eco-system stability and biodiversity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The theoretical frameworks, including sustainability, resilience, adaptive practice, may be helpful when considering urban resilience. We suggest that all of the considerations should cooperate through the practical implementation. Given this, design consideration to vertical greening for urban sustainability may be categorized as those: (1) the enhancement with vertical greening in urban setting, whether in the interior or exterior environment, can aid in the regenerative role toward the restoration of the urban ecological landscape; (2) the recent progress on smart building technology further enhanced the management for comfort, biodiversity and well-being benefits of vertical greening; (3) ideas and practices permutations of the systemic design possibilities for vertical greening contribute to the resilience of the urban core; (4) the outcome focuses on the design thinking process into the practice of vertical greening aimed for sustainable conscious architecture, advantageous on their potential for human's well-being and health, at the same time, being feasible for amelioration of our urban microclimate condition, opportunity and threats; together, they contribute toward the sustainability for the future of urbanity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The results indicate that environmental and natural criteria like, distance from the residential areas and water bodies, and biodiversity conservation are the most significant considerations for a sustainable plant location. Policy and legal criteria like, support from local authorities and financial support, ranked as the second while, economical aspects like, proximity to the waste collection point, and slope ranked as the third best criteria for decision on a sustainable recycling plant location. The study established the consistency and robustness of the results by performing two sets of sensitivity analysis. One by changing the weight specified for the main criteria and the other, by modifying the weight specified for a specific expert. The study will facilitate WEEE recycling companies in their decision making for facility location and also, the policy makers in increasing the effectiveness of the national WEEE management policy, by providing insights on the sustainability factors for recycling plant locations around which incentives can be built and disclosure regulations be designed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This article assesses the multi-actor co-innovation research that was carried out between 2010 and 2018 by researchers and apple production actors. The aim was to develop sustainable integrated pest management methods that, with the help of an agroecological whole system approach, would be both desirable and feasible to implement in practice. Whilst a novel pest management strategy based on semiochemicals arrived at and was rapidly adopted by growers, the enhancement of biological control through functional diversity required long-term learning. This is explained by substantial differences in the perception of the economic risk and the necessary knowledge behind the adoption of each method. The knowledge gap due to the reduced number of extension advisors and the conflict between the cost incurred when implementing low-impact pest control methods and reduced profitability of apple crops were pointed out as major contradictions by the actors. We suggest that strengthened regional agroecological infrastructure support along with the expansion of public advisory service personnel would reduce the farmer economic risk and share the responsibility for a safer environment and healthier food. Similarly, relevant authorities should be provided with resources to allow for safety assessments of candidate low-risk plant protection products at the regional scale. As a conclusion, we recognised that in our region sustainable agroecosystem management through feasible and desirable plant protection strategies could not be developed solely by focussing on the efficiency of the tools because the cost-effectiveness and thus the implementation of such tools depended greatly on the simultaneous co-innovation of the socio-technical system. Local stakeholders need to harmonise their vision and standpoints to engender long term socially and environmentally sound objectives providing a base to promote, finance and extensively adopt innovative plant protection strategies within the Skåne region. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

As yet, there has been no comprehensive quantitative review of research on megaproject sustainability. Hence, in this study, a scientometric review was conducted of 134 papers that present hybrid approaches (e.g., document statistics, GPS visualization, co-occurrence analysis, and cluster network), with the aim of providing an accurate and holistic summary of this realm. These research documents on megaproject sustainability are classified into six categories according to their focuses, including mega event, socio economic, growth coalition, environmental licensing, tension points, and the private sector. On this basis, a 3P framework (i.e., purpose, people, and process) is established to showcase a road map for sustainable megaproject development. This study provides researchers, developers, and policymakers with a systematic and in-depth understanding of global sustainability research in megaproject management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Waste composting is a process which is spreading worldwide to reduce waste disposal in landfill. The composting technical currents give little attention to the type and chemical composition of biomass that are mixed not considering that these can affect quality and maturity of the compost produced. In addition, during the composting process the amount of oxygen and temperature are generally only monitored but not set up. Our hypothesis is that composts, prepared from different organic wastes, can be chemically different with consequent different fertilizer properties. Stability and quality of composts are dependent on multivariate parameters such as raw material source, proportions used, composting procedure, and maturation time. Starting from this consideration a composting experiment was carried out to evaluate if were the raw materials (chemical composition, mixture and ratio), or the composting conditions and time, to influence the maturity or the quality of composts. We prepared four composts starting from different combinations and ratios of vegetable residues and/or olive pomace. After 120 days, the four composts were physically, chemically and biologically characterized to evaluate maturity degree, stability and quality of the products obtained under the same composting conditions and time. Their ability, as soil improver, was evaluated assessing soil chemical and biochemical properties 90 days after the compost addition. Here we show that the chemical composition of raw materials and the set up parameters of composting processes can have a different weight in influencing compost stability and quality. Our results evidenced that during the composting process all the composts had a similar percentage of C/N ratio reduction and all of them achieved an acceptable maturity degree. The composts produced by olive pomace showed the highest degree of maturity as demonstrated by T value and organic matter loss, both indices of compost stability. Conversely the composts coming from green vegetable residues were richest in nutrients and phenols and had the highest CSC all indices of better quality. In this work we identified two composts able to increase carbon stock, and water holding capacity parameters that positively influence soil structure, and two compost able to increase the amount of soil microbial biomass, their activity and soil biodiversity, improving soil biological fertility. These results highlighted that compost maturity doesn't mean compost quality, suggesting that compost maturity is mainly linked to composting setup parameters, while compost quality is mainly linked to chemical composition. FDA and DHA activities have been identified as markers for assessing the quality of amended soils. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Product impacts on ecosystem quality have long been addressed by the topdown approach known as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Impacts are most of the time assessed within the “biodiversity loss” damage category indicator. However, LCA methods do not cover the 5 drivers of biodiversity loss as identified by (Millenium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005) (MEA): only land occupation and transformation, pollution, and climate change are covered, while species overexploitation and invasive species are not. Besides, ecologists work on the ground to measure concrete impacts from given practices on biodiversity in specific areas for some parts of the value chain of the product (e.g. production of agricultural biomaterial). The Product Biodiversity Footprint (PBF) approach aims at bridging the gap between LCA and ecology. Its objective is to allow comparison of variants of a given product to support eco-design, addressing the five drivers of MEA. The methodology combines LCA and ecology current knowledge and organizes them towards practical indicators and representations for business decision. PBF has been tested in three business case studies. The one for L'Oréal presented herewith shows that the integration of ecological data enables to refine and complement LCA results. This method at product level is, to our knowledge, the first to address the five MEA drivers on biodiversity along the value chain, with a combination of quantitative and semi-quantitative indicators. Stemming from an LCA global framework and approach, ecology knowledge adds refinements that enable to distinguish between different anthropogenic practices and better informed decision making. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Wind farms are a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels and may mitigate the effects of climate change. However, they have complex ecological consequences, especially their negative effects on birds. The East China coast is a key part of the East Asian-Australasian flyway (EAAF) for migratory waterbirds, and numerous wind farms have been or will be built in this region owing to high electricity demand and wind energy resources. However, little is known regarding the effects of large-scale wind farms of the East China coast on biodiversity conservation. The negative effects of wind farms on waterbirds that overwinter here could be reduced by understanding waterbird distribution and movement around wind turbines in these areas. From 2017 to 2019, we selected the Chongming Islands as our study area, which are one of the most important hot spots for migratory waterbirds of the East China coast and have sufficient wind generation potential to achieve energy sustainability, to study how to coordinate coastal wind farm development (existing and planned wind farms) and waterbird conservation (important waterbird habitats and buffer zone due to characteristic of waterbird activity). We identified four coastal natural wetlands of international importance for waterbirds according to 16 field surveys in 2017–2018. We found that over 63.16% species and 89.86% of waterbirds flew regularly across a dyke in Chongming Dongtan, where the wind farms are generally located, and used the natural intertidal wetland as a feeding ground and artificial habitat behind the dyke as a supplementary habitat for foraging and roosting. Additionally, with 4603 locations of 14 GPS/GSM tracked waterbirds (seven shorebirds and seven ducks) in Chongming Dongtan in 2018–2019, we further demonstrated that more than 60% of waterbird locations were within a distance of 800–1300 m from the dyke, and this distance could be defined as a buffer zone to protect waterbirds. Finally, we found that 67 existing wind turbines adjacent to four important coastal habitats on the Chongming Islands may influence waterbirds based on our finding of the buffer zone for waterbird conservation. We concluded that the settlement of wind farms should be avoided not only in important coastal natural wetlands for waterbird conservation but also in a proper buffer zone covering the artificial wetlands, such as aquaculture ponds and paddy fields adjoining these important natural wetlands. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Biodiversity loss is a critical sustainability issue, and companies are beginning to seek ways to assess their biodiversity performance. Initiatives to date have developed biodiversity indicators for specific business contexts (e.g., spatial scales—from site, to product, to regional, or corporate scales); however, many are not widely translatable across different contexts making it challenging for businesses seeking indicators to manage their biodiversity performance. By synthesising the steps of common conservation and business decision-making systems, we propose a framework to support more comprehensive development of quantitative biodiversity indicators, for a range of business contexts. The framework integrates experience from existing tried-and-tested conservation frameworks. We illustrate how our framework offers a pathway for businesses to assess their biodiversity performance and demonstrate responsible management by mitigating and reversing their biodiversity impacts and sustaining their dependencies, enabling them to demonstrate their contribution to emerging global biodiversity targets (e.g., Convention on Biological Diversity post-2020 targets). © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {Social production and consumption in highly urbanized agglomerations dramatically aggravate the creation of reactive nitrogen (Nr). Excess Nr increases the aggregate risk of air and water quality deterioration, biodiversity loss and human health impairment. The aim of this study is to assess the aggregate risk of Nr under anthropogenic disturbance based on an exposure-effect model reconciling the Nr behavior in urban environment and corresponding integrated damage impacts. In a case study of Pearl River Delta (PRD) urban agglomeration, the Nr creation and distribution were quantitatively estimated in different subsystems. The various ecosystem service and human benefit losses related to Nr accumulation pressure were classified and quantified though damage costs obtained from literature. The results showed that anthropogenic disturbance dramatically changed the Nr creation and accumulation in this urban agglomeration compared with the average level for all of China. Anthropogenic Nr creation in the PRD urban agglomeration was 355.70 Gg, and total Nr accumulation in all subsystems was 607.05 Gg in 2010. With high industrialization and urbanization, Nr tended to flow into the atmosphere and water to generate risk rather than into the land. The damage impacts of Nr in the PRD urban agglomeration centered on human health impairment (40.97%), fuel and fiber production loss (23.55%), climate and air quality decline (22.41%). To harmonize the relationship between risk management and human economic drivers, sustainable human activity changes in vehicle use, denitrification engineering and nitrogen use efficiency are suggested. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Wetlands (rivers, lakes, bogs, etc.), the biodiversity hotspots, provide habitats for biology on Earth and play an important role in biodiversity protection around the world. However, they are damaged by dam construction all over the world. Many studies have been conducted on the effects of dam construction on biodiversity, but a review about it is missing. The objectives of this review are: (1) to discuss the effects of dam construction on biodiversity in freshwater wetlands; and (2) to identify the future directions for research in this field. To achieve these objectives, 347 significant publications from 2000 to 2017 were selected (based on a rigorous screening processes and a systematic literature review approach) from the ISI Web of Knowledge database. Dam construction decreased the water fungal biomass and richness in reservoirs and downstream reaches, but increased the amount of soil microorganisms in downstream lake wetlands. The studies about effects of dam on benthos mainly focused on macroinvertebrate, periphyton and mussel. Most studies about the effects on macroinvertebrate claimed that dam construction caused increases in biomass and decreases in taxa richness in downstream reaches. The studies about effects of dam on plankton mainly focused on phytoplankton, zooplankton, planktonic microorganisms and ichthyoplankton. Effects of dam on fish (including aquatic mammals) included blocking migration route, habitat fragmentation, changing from lotic to lentic water in the impounded area, release of hypolimnetic cold water of reservoir, and changes of water flow in downstream reaches. Studies about effects of dam construction on botany mainly focused on the riparian plants, but there were few studies on floating plants and submerged macrophyte and effects of dam construction on botany in downstream lake wetlands. There were only few studies that examined these effects of dam on bird. We also pointed out the future directions for research in this field. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The debate on land-sparing versus land-sharing has continued for decades regarding which of the two approaches can optimize the yield-conservation tradeoff. Current opinions are mostly criticisms for the overly-narrow focus on specific biodiversity conservation and simplistic solution to the agri-environmental scheme. This study based on limitations in previous studies aims to advance the land-sparing versus land-sharing strategies from two perspectives. First,an extended framework highlighting the tradeoffs between built-up land and green space in urban regions was proposed. Second, the multi-functionality of natural land was characterized by various ecosystem services rather than merely biodiversity. To demonstrate the applicability of the framework, a practical case of green space sparing -the Ecological Red Line (ERL) policy currently implemented across China-was elaborated. Particularly, soil retention was selected as a proxy to compare the difference between green space and unprotected areas. It showed that (1) the soil retention difference between areas inside and outside the ERL continued steady before the implementing of the ERL and thereafter presented upward trend. (2) the aggregate pattern and scale of soil retention changed obvious after the implementing of the ERL. (3) environment factors underlying the spatial variation of soil retention varied in inner and outer areas of the ERL, and the ERL might ameliorate soil retention of different land use types by spill-over effect. These findings demonstrated the effectiveness of the ERL, and further supported that the green space sparing is a promising strategy for urban land management. The ERL case study provides empirical evidence to support applications of the extended land-sparing versus land-sharing framework in urban regions. © 2019},

This study develops a new indicator for assessing consequential impacts on ocean resources in life cycle assessment. The indicator is based on primary production required, a concept previously used in ecological assessments and life cycle assessments to evaluate ecological impacts of fisheries and aquaculture. We estimate the primary production required for fishmeal production from the ocean (166 kg carbon/kg fishmeal), and the potential of defatted microalgae biomass displacing fishmeal. Results show that defatted microalgae biomass can lead to highly variable, but potentially significant, reductions in ocean resource demand. The variability is a function of the potential for replacement, which depends on the cultured fish species considered. As an example of this significance, based on available data for estimating the potential for defatted microalgal biomass to displace fishmeal for cultured tilapia, salmon, shrimp, carp, flounder, yellowtail and cod, by 2020 net primary production demand from the ocean could be reduced by approximately one billion tons of carbon. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Food security and biodiversity conservation are closely interconnected challenges to be addressed to achieve a sustainable food system on a global scale. Due to the complex nature of food production and consumption system, quantifying the impacts of food supply chains on biodiversity is challenging. Life cycle assessment (LCA) allows for systematically addressing environmental impacts along supply chains, representing a reference methodology that can be applied for assessing food systems. In the present study, 32 representative food products of consumption in the European Union (EU) were selected and their environmental impacts calculated through a process-based LCA. The potential contribution of EU food consumption to the current biodiversity decline has been evaluated adopting both midpoint and endpoint indicators. A comparison of the impact drivers was performed. Meat products, the underpinning land use for agricultural purposes, and climate change represent the main hotspots of impacts on biodiversity. Notwithstanding several drivers of biodiversity loss can be accounted for with LCA, the evidence of the increasing biodiversity decline on both a European and a global scale indicates that the assessment system should be further expanded, especially for what concerns refining impact categories such as ecotoxicity, and including resource overexploitation, and impact due to invasive species. This study illustrates: how far the current LCA based impact assessment framework may help to address the drivers of biodiversity loss; which are the main uncertainties associated to results stemming from the application of different endpoint methods; which aspects need to be elaborated further to ensure a comprehensive assessment of biodiversity impacts due to food production and consumption. © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {Determining what factors affect the relationship between ecosystem services (benefits people derive from ecosystems) and how the impact distributed, is conducive to strengthening ecological governance and improving the sustainable development of the ecological environment. However, previous studies remained difficulties in directly regressing with potential impact factors after spatializing the relationship between ecosystem services (ESs) and neglected the impact of urbanization. Therefore, we asked the following: (i) Whether the relationship between ecosystem services is spatially heterogeneous? (ii) Whether the relationship between ecosystem services is only related to the natural environment or is also affected by urbanization? (iii) Are the correlations between such relationship and latent influencing factors consistent in space? In this study, we mapped the relationships between four ESs (grain productivity, carbon storage, outdoor recreation, and biodiversity conservation), and analyzed the spatial correlation between such relationships and ecological factors and urbanization factors, using geographically weighted logical regression (GWLR). The relationship between ESs is spatially heterogeneous, and a refined mechanism for the relationship between ESs was proposed in this study to explain it. The occurrence of the synergy and tradeoff between ESs is not only related to the natural environment but also affected by urbanization, that the relationships are robustly correlated to landform factor, meteorological factors, and urbanization factors; and the properties and intensity of the correlations varied with space. This study allows generalization, that the data, models, and software used in this study are universal in the field; the relevant factors selected in this study are also universal and meaningful in other study areas; research in other regions or larger scale regions can refer to the method and mechanism proposed in this study. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Climate warming and plant invasions are among the most serious threads to biodiversity and stability in terrestrial ecosystems. A particular challenge is to predict how soil microbial communities and edaphic factors will change under future conditions. Despite evidence that soil microbial community structure can be shifted by experimental warming and plant invasion, few studies were conducted to quantify the interactive effect of both factors. Here, we compared soil microbial diversity, bacterial community, and soil physiochemical properties in both surface (0–5 cm) and subsurface (5–20 cm) soils of two-year open-top chambers (OTCs) warming and Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) invasion treatments with no warming and Phragmites australis (P. australis) treatments. Results showed that surface soil water content, total organic carbon, total nitrogen (TN), and the ratio of TN to total phosphorous (N:P) were significantly decreased by experimental warming, while pH was significantly enhanced. Soil TN was significantly enhanced in the mixed community of P. australis and S. alterniflora compared with single species community. Soil TP was gradually decreased with the proportion of S. alterniflora increasing by experimental warming. Soil bacterial α diversity was not changed by either experimental warming or S. alterniflora invasion. Experimental warming significantly shifted soil bacterial community, whereas S. alterniflora invasion and their interaction showed no impact. Redundancy analysis showed soil bacterial community structure was highly correlated with soil edaphic factors (i.e. pH, TN, and NH4 +-N). Prediction of microbial function profiles revealed that several bacterial functions, especially carbon and nitrogen metabolism pathways, were adjusted to tolerate warming. Overall, our results demonstrated that experimental warming significantly altered soil bacterial community and physiochemical properties of S. alterniflora and P. australis communities, and should be considered in ecologically sustainable development of Chongming Island and wetland ecosystem. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

This requires employing advanced tools and methods such as the Geographic information system (GIS) to back the decision-making process. The study presents the application on a case study “Qattara Depression”- a 20,000 Km                             2                              development project which has received a lot of attention; on one hand, for its expected benefits to achieve Egypt 2030 national plan in terms of clean electricity generation, while, on the other hand, some concerns have been raised regarding its environmental consequences. The study centers on the project's desalination development scenario considering five main environmental impacts; loss of biodiversity and threats to natural habitat, hydrogeological environmental impact, land use effect and terrestrial impact, impacts on marine life as well as natural hazards and casualties. The study uses the GIS overlaying and querying tools to determine and categorize the problematic areas into major, moderate and minor impact areas, in addition to providing recommendations for addressing their associated challenges. As a preliminary step, the study defines the limits of the area of interest (AOI) in terms of its proximity to the Mediterranean Sea and the River Nile. Each impact is represented with feature datasets including a number of feature classes. Then, the buffering impact area of each individual feature class is defined and overlaid to determine the extent of impacts for the proposed scenario. It is found that the critical sensitive areas are located in the northeastern tip and the western part of the AOI. This indicates that these areas should receive careful attention while planning for any kind of development activities. The results contribute towards setting a comprehensive clue to support the strategic planning objectives and mitigation measures for this huge development project in the Western Desert area.                          © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

This study discuss the spatial and temporal variation of patterns and interactions of five HESs (biodiversity maintenance, water yield, soil conservation, aquatic purification and water production) in plain and mountain regions to determine synergies and trade-offs at the sub-catchment scale and county scale from 1980 to 2015, and this study employ a case study in the western plain and eastern mountain part of the Nansihu Lake basin in eastern China. The correlation analysis and bagplot analysis were applied to analyze the linkages between HESs, and then redundancy analysis was used to identify important drivers of spatial patterns and interactions of HESs based on socio-ecological variables (e.g., climate, topography, land use, gross domestic product and population density). The results demonstrate that the intercorrelations among HESs varied significantly between the western plain and eastern mountain in both the strength and the direction of the correlating HESs. It was found that there was a trade-off between the water yield and water production in the provisioning services in the eastern mountain basin, while there was no correlation in the western plain basin. Trade-offs and synergies in the entire basin varied greatly over time and space. Compared to the sub-catchment scale, the relationships among the different HESs were mostly weak and some were not significant at the county scale. The study also revealed that topography, land use and climate were the main driving factors affecting the distribution of HESs and their relationships. This study suggested that the sub-catchment scale was more suitable for policy analysts and policy-makers that are concerned with HESs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

It was found that, generally, the environmental prospects for European countries has improved over the last decade and have been reversely correlated to the deadweight loss. However, the inefficiency level of EU countries’ policy, is on average, relatively higher than what was reported in different regions of the world.

The role of plant species diversity for “ecological intensification” of agriculture has been widely recognised, but the potential contribution of multi-trophic-level production systems, such as rice-fish co-culture, has received less attention. A continuous 4-year experiment (2015–2018) was conducted comparing rice-fish (yellow finless eel and loach) co-culture, and mono-rice planting practices on the Chongming Eco-island of China. During the experiment, pests (insect herbivores and weeds), arthropods, pesticides, grain and marketable fish yield were sampled, soil quality (available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, total nitrogen, organic matter content and pH) and rice grain quality (protein content, chalkiness, gel consistency, amylose content) were evaluated, and an economic analysis were performed. Fish decreased herbivore insect abundance by 24.07%, reduced weeds abundance, richness and biomass by 67.62, 62.01 and 58.88% respectively, increased invertebrate predator abundance by 19.48%, and reduced the need for pesticide by 23.4%. Co-culture practice produced an average economic values 10.33% higher than in the mono-rice farming. In addition, rice-fish co-culture enhanced both soil and rice quality. Our results confirm that rice-fish co-culture can be an effective form of ecological intensification, incorporating and contributing ecosystem services in agricultural production and increasing sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

This study evaluates three of the first PES schemes in Thailand, financed by large corporations in the water utilities, aquaculture, and beverage sectors. Interviews with 39 business managers and project stakeholders suggest that PES may be viewed as a tool for philanthropy, public relations, and gaining license to operate—akin to many corporate social responsibility initiatives.

	abstract = {The over-exploitation of natural capital and unsustainable production practices has contributed to increased pollution, biodiversity loss, drought, and deforestation. The food and beverage (F&B) sector is one of the largest contributors to the Indonesian economy but it is also responsible for various environmental impacts. Implementing Environmental Management Systems (EMS) is one way to promote improved sustainable practices within organisations, particularly those within the F&B sector. This research investigates the drivers, barriers and incentives for implementing EMS and their causal relationships. Data were collected from 59 F&B companies in East Java, Indonesia. The results indicate that the implementation of EMS tends to be driven internally in an effort to enhance market competitiveness. There is a need for institutions to exert pressures to develop organizational capability to implement EMS. External barriers are significant impeding factors, while internal barriers do not have a direct link to EMS implementation. The moderating role of technical incentives underlines the need to improve infrastructure and policy to support EMS implementation. Theoretical and practical insights for governments and industries are also discussed. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment},

	abstract = {As an important part of terrestrial ecosystem and the most sensitive to environmental changes, mountainous areas are rich in biodiversity and high value of ecosystem productivity. However, due to the unsustainable exploitation of natural resources, most of the world's mountain ecosystems are being subjected to soil erosion and biodiversity is rapidly being lost, so the establishment of mountain ecological reserves is of great importance. In view of this, this paper used the Qinling-Daba Mountain, Qinling Mountain and Daba Mountain of China as the research area. On the basis of various simulated ecosystem service from 2000 to 2015, the root mean square deviation analysis and ordered weighted averaged model were used to determine the spatial changes of ecosystem service on environmental gradients, the tradeoff between ecosystem services and the selection of optimal protection areas. Our results proved that ① net primary production, soil conservation and habitat quality were increase significantly with increasing altitude and vegetation cover fraction gradient, but were weaken water yield and grain production. ② The change in the trade-off between multiple pairs of ecosystem services in the Daba Mountain was stronger than in the Qinling-Daba Mountain and the Qinling Mountain, especially the trade-off relationship related to water yield. ③ Considering various scenarios and conservation efficiency, it was found that scenario 7 was the best solution. The net primary production, soil conservation, habitat quality, grain production, and water yield protection efficiency were 1.261, 4.845, 1.059, 1.333, and 1.390 respectively. Priority conservation areas were mainly distributed in mid-altitude, high-vegetation, and high-mean annual precipitation areas. In this study, the combination of ecosystem services and priority conservation areas can play an important role in the management of the Qinling-Daba Mountain, and provides a meaningful reference for the selection of nature reserves. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Modern manufacturing industries thrive for energy efficient, clean and sustainable machining processes. However, achieving these objectives becomes difficult especially in machining Ti-6Al-4V as it retains its properties at high temperature. Cryogenic liquid nitrogen (LN2) is a clean machining environment that has potential to improve the machinability performance for Ti-6Al-4V. LN2 promotes sustainability and facilitates low carbon emission. Orientation and number of employed LN2 jets influence the cutting energy, quality and productivity. Moreover, a balance between energy consumption and quality-productivity is required for sustainable production. In this respect, this research work studies the cutting force, specific energy, temperature, surface quality (i.e. surface roughness), and material removal rate under the impingement of LN2 as mono-jet and dual-jets. This study has three parts: evaluation of the role of factors on the output parameters, optimization of parameters, and lastly the life cycle assessment (LCA) of cryogenic LN2 assisted machining. Owing to irreconcilable nature of single-objective optimization, multi-response optimization was conducted using Grey-Taguchi integrated approach. It was found that LN2 dual-jets were most effective in reducing the specific energy consumption and temperature, and improving surface quality. This can be attributed to the faster and effective heat removal by LN2 from the critical interfaces. Other optimum parameters were cutting speed of 140 m/min and feed rate of 0.16 mm/rev. It was found that LCA showed that there is a clear relation between cooling strategy and environmental aspects such as resources, energy, human health, and biodiversity, etc. that directly affects the machining performance of Ti-6Al-4V alloy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

We develop our comprehensive 53 disclosure index and create and test OLS regression model to measure the relationships between B/E disclosures and its determinants factors including environmental performance, industry sector, country, assurance, environmental awards, presence of biodiversity partners, and the number of species' related disclosure. Our results reveal that there are positive significant relationships between B/E disclosure and assurance provided by the Big 4: gaining an environmental award, companies from high biodiversity risk sectors, developing countries, presence of biodiversity partners, and how many specific biodiversity words are published in companies' reports. On the other hand, there are positive insignificant relationships between B/E disclosure and assurance: poor performers and the number of species disclosed in companies' reports.

	abstract = {Impacts of bioeconomy on climate have been much discussed, but less attention has been given to biodiversity deterioration. One approach to assess biodiversity impacts is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Finland is a forested country with intensive forest industries, but only coarse biodiversity LCA methods are available. The aim of this study was to further develop and apply approaches to assess the biodiversity impacts of wood use in Finland. With the species richness approach (all taxons included), biodiversity impacts were higher in Southern than in Northern Finland but impacts in Southern and Northern Finland were lower when mammals, birds and molluscs were included. With the ecosystem indicators approach, if the reference situation were forest in its natural state, biodiversity impacts were higher than in the case where the initial state of forest before final felling was used to derive biodiversity loss. In both cases, the biodiversity impacts were higher in Northern Finland. These results were not coherent as the model applying species richness data assesses biodiversity loss based on all species, whereas the ecosystem indicators approach considers vulnerable species. One limitation of the species richness approach was that there were no reliable datasets available. In the ecosystem indicators approach, it was noticed that the biodiversity of managed Finnish forests is substantially lower than in natural forests. Biodiversity LCA approaches are highly sensitive to reference states, applied model and data. It is essential to develop approaches capable of comparing biodiversity impacts of forest management practices, or when looking at multiple environmental impacts simultaneously with the LCA framework. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In many parts of the world, renewable energy is being considered as an alternative to supply electricity to communities in developing regions. However, even though various technologies are becoming available, there are several socio-environmental constraints that impinge on the viability of ocean energy conversion projects in isolated communities. By assessing environmental restrictions and socioeconomic attributes where electric power may be produced from the ocean can be useful in prioritizing the locations (especially those isolated) where this alternative is more viable. This paper examines socio-economic and environmental factors that may affect the introduction of ocean energy harvesting in areas currently without electricity. Our findings reveal that: a) in the coastal area of the state of Michoacán, southwest Mexico (at < 20 km from the coast and <100 m.a.s.l.), 153 human settlements with over 4,000 inhabitants lack electric power; 16 of these settlements are indigenous; b) economic activities are mostly fisheries and ecotourism; yet, marginalizaion is very high in the area; c) there are four protected areas with nesting sites for several marine turtle species (greater black, hawksbill, leatherback, and green); the “Deep Pacific Sea” natural protected area harbors great biodiversity; and d) electric power may be produced from ocean energy, especially waves, currents and thermal gradients. The infrastructure for grid connection and technical and logistical support is limited, and the topography near the coast is complex. However, our results indicate that the coastal region of Michoacan, has promising sources of ocean energy, especially for isolated settlements with limited, or no, electricity supply. The results show that waves and thermal gradients are viable options for energy generation in the area studied. Considering socioeconomic conditions and environmental restrictions, our observations suggest that, in particular, ocean energy projects might be successfully implemented in two locations on the coast of Michoacan, Future on-site studies into the environmental impact, the percepction and acceptance of society towards the new technologies and economic costs are necessary before implementing these new technologies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Hydropower has a damaging effect on aquatic biodiversity globally. Extensive research has demonstrated the significance of plant diversity in sustaining wetland services and functions. However, wetland plant diversity conservation has rarely been considered in hydropower operation optimization, and the relationship between hydropower generation and plant diversity indicators has rarely been quantified. In this study, a new optimization approach is proposed for reservoir operation to balance hydropower generation and plant diversity conservation in downstream wetlands. We identify key hydrological indicators affecting wetland plant diversity, accounting for the richness and abundance of plants as well as the evenness of multiple plant species. An artificial neural network (ANN) is subsequently adopted to quantify the complex relationship between hydrological and plant diversity indicators. Using the ANN model for plant diversity prediction, we develop a multi-objective optimization model for reservoir operation to maximize hydropower generation and wetland plant diversity indicators. This approach is applied to a large plant-dominated wetland (Baiyangdian) in China as a case study. Using a genetic algorithm to solve the optimization model, we suggest a reservoir operation scheme which can increase multi-year averaged plant diversity indicator in this wetland by 20% while decreasing reservoir hydropower generation by 10%. We also generate a set of Pareto-optimal solutions from the optimization model, which quantifies the tradeoff relationship between hydropower generation and plant diversity conservation. This relationship provides a reference for managers in determining reservoir operation rules depending on the demands on these two conflicting objectives. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) stress the necessity of private businesses’ active participation, appealing for their creativity and innovation to create value for the common good, such as reducing poverty, eradicating hunger, and protecting biodiversity. While currently some, especially recently formed private businesses may consider the common good as their main business goal, most existing stock-listed businesses clearly do not. The question that arises is why private stock-listed businesses should voluntarily engage with such common good objectives while being principally shareholder value oriented. This study aims to map the undiscovered terrain of corporate SDG involvement as emanating from the sustainability reports of the 2000 largest stock listed businesses worldwide. The methodology is based on an exploratory two-step approach. First, using logistic and quantile regressions, potential associations between reported SDG involvement and corporation attributes are investigated quantitatively for a sample of the 2000 largest stock listed corporations worldwide. Secondly, the most extensive SDG reporters are analyzed qualitatively in order to explore what is actually disclosed. The quantitative results show that corporate involvement in the SDGs is overall still limited, and mainly associated with commitment to other sustainability-related themes and East Asian country settings, as well as company size, and corporate sustainability level. Such implies that SDG involvement is inspired by a mixture of legitimacy and institutional motives. However, when the level of involvement is analyzed, a much more scattered picture occurs. Global Compact membership is the only factor that is consistently highly significant. More importantly, qualitative scrutiny of the individual reports reveals that company involvement is largely symbolic and intentional, rather than substantive. This suggests that companies treat the SDGs, similarly to the Global Compact, as a scheme with non-committal implications, facilitating impression management and learning. This study provides an initial understanding of current corporate practice, as well as clues for theorizing this largely unexplored research field. Practically, the overall lack of meaningful SDG disclosures implies that stakeholders with an SDG interest cannot rely on sustainability reports for their decisions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The aim is to transform students’ attitudes by learning from communities committed to achieving sustainable development. Small organic producers, consumers, farmers, organic companies, environmental NGOs and several environmental policymakers were appointed to interact with students both in schools and in visits to farms and companies over three years (from 2016 to 2018). Seven criteria were developed among 389 young students, namely, waste management, transport, energy, climate change, biodiversity, water and citizenship. Students were asked about their willingness to transform their environmental attitudes to protect nature through experiential learning. The hypotheses were validated through SmartPLS path modelling, and the results have shown the efficiency of this method when raising environmental awareness in young students. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {There is an increasing demand for N-fertilizers and the manufacture of N-products worldwide. In Mexico, ammonia production is being promoted by the government, but this development is associated with several environmental impacts. This study examines the causes, effects and mitigation alternatives related to the installation and operation of an ammonia production plant adjacent to a coastal lagoon. A multiplicity of causes (and effects) was identified: water suction (elimination of plankton and larvae), effluent discharge (thermal contamination, salinization, and the effects of chlorine), and the conversion of wetlands (loss of habitat and nursery areas, biodiversity, fishery benefits, retention of contaminants, coastal stabilization, carbon storage and aesthetic value). At present, it is estimated that wetlands (9146 ha mangroves + 22,641 ha others) in the Ohuira-Topolobampo lagoon sustain the production of 3000 t live weight of seafood catches per year, implying that the conversion of 126 ha of wetlands could represent for fishermen a catch reduction of 11.9–41.3 t of shellfish per year and a decrease in the annual retention load of up 0.52 kg Cd, 41.0 kg Cu, 0.40 kg Hg, 280 kg Pb, 88.2 t P and 75.6 t N by wetland sediments. To mitigate the environmental effects associated with the installation and operation of the plant, the following is recommended: (i) afforestation of an equivalent area (126 ha), (ii) installation of an exclusion system for fauna to avoid the incidental capture of plankton and larvae, (iii) the use of cooling towers, and (iv) the selection of an appropriate discharge point for the effluent. A list of fauna and flora of the lagoon, as well as environmental services that could be compromised and affected by the operation of the ammonia production plant, is presented. This study is the first to analyze and document such effects and mitigation options related to land conversion and water management, providing useful information for decision makers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {As open pit (OP) mines grow downward, more waste rocks are produced. Thus, the waste removal and management costs increase exponentially. On the other hand, waste rocks spoil natural surfaces, water resources, and local biodiversity surrounding mining areas. These reasons motivate the shareholders to shift from their routine mining method toward an underground (UG) operation by which less waste rocks are extracted. The depth of this transition should be determined so as to achieve maximum profit from the entire project (OP & UG). The present study aims to evaluate the amount of waste rock reduction while optimizing the transition depth. To this end, an integer programming (IP) optimization model was executed on a real orebody. The results indicated that waste rock generation decreases up to 7.5 million tons while the net present value (NPV) of the project increases up to 0.28%. In addition, due to this optimization, around 4.5% of natural surfaces, which had been initially allocated to the disposal site, remained uncontaminated. Further, based on acid base accounting (ABA) test, it was concluded that waste rocks do not have acid generation potential and, thus, can be used as backfilled material. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Payment for ecosystem services (PES) links social and ecological outcomes from a stakeholder's view and is an important angle in ecosystem service valuations. In considering spatial ecosystem services flows, a geographical perspective on assessments of ecosystem services is required in PES studies. This study analyzed 2445 face-to-face questionnaires for both tourists and inhabitants on the topic of willingness to pay (WTP) for nature in the Tibetan Plateau. Six ecosystem services were used to represent nature's contributions to people, including water conservation, soil retention, carbon fixation, pollution decomposition, biodiversity conservation, and aesthetics. Then, the ecosystem management attitudes and related factors of China's tourists were linked in 7 of China's geographical regions. The results show that inhabitants in the Tibetan Plateau pay the most on the top limit of payment (882 CNY/year); water conservation is the service with the highest value (177–248 CNY/year), and the natural aesthetic has the lowest value (99–127 CNY/year). The subjective indicators link the payments much more closely than the objective indicators as a higher willingness and knowledge of the Tibetan Plateau locals increases their willingness to pay more. The regional potential linkages between indicators and ecosystem management attitudes are inconsistent, and the highest difference is between the opinions of inhabitants and tourists. Chinese tourists’ valuations of ecosystem services are culturally shared, since the regional differences in both the payment amounts and ecosystem management attitudes are not obvious. The findings can provide an understanding of the relational values of ecosystem services, as well as publicizing ecosystem management in the Tibetan Plateau. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Sustainability in fishing, shell fishing and recreational activities makes it advisable to develop measures such as the implementation of green artificial reefs (AR), which promote wealth and biodiversity in areas that stand out due to their productive capacity. This document proposes a database management system (DBMS) to determine the position of the AR groups, based on geographic information systems (GIS) combined with high resolution numerical modelling and the development of computational algorithms. This system will be capable of analysing a large amount of spatial information regarding socio-economic and environmental factors that affect their installation. The methodology considered in the DBMS takes into account production factors and economic factors related to construction and maintenance. This combination allows for the identification of the best locations for the functional development of the AR group with low implementation costs. The DBMS is applied to the Ria of Ares-Betanzos leading to the definition of the most suitable places for installing AR groups in this area. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Here we estimate NPPpot agricultural footprint, that is, the level of appropriation of potential net primary production (NPPpot) by global cropland and human-made pastures from the consumer responsibility (footprint) perspective and reveal the role of international trade. To quantify the NPPpot agricultural footprint, we utilize environmentally extended multi-regional input–output analysis to attribute the terrestrial potential NPP altered by global cropland and human-made pastures to the final consumers responsible for pulling the supply chains. We identify the NPPpot of geographically specific cropland area of 186 agricultural crops in 236 countries and we track each of those crops through the global web of international trade and supply chains to the point of final consumption. We show that human society appropriates 20% (13 petagrams of carbon per year) of global potential net primary production by the transformation of natural ecosystems into cropland and human-made pastures. International trade accounts for 23% of global NPPpot footprint of agriculture. While the two and half billion people living in China and India (the two countries with lowest NPPpot agricultural footprint per capita) appropriate about 16% of the global NPPpot agricultural footprint of cropland and human-made pastures, the same share is appropriated by only 360 million people living in countries with the highest per capita footprint. © 2019 by Yale University},

	abstract = {High-speed railways (HSR) operators communicate their economic, social, and environmental performance through annual and sustainability reports. There is no one unified sustainability reporting framework that combines HSR issues together under the three pillars of sustainability's cover. Also, no previous studies have specifically examined sustainability reporting practices of HSR operators. This paper has two objectives; to select and validate social, economic, and environmental factors that are representative of the sustainable performance of HSRs, and to examine the availability of these factors in HSR operators’ reports. After being selected, all factors are validated through consultation with experts of the International Union of Railways (UIC). Having validated the 26 selected factors, the author searched for evidence of these factors in 15 documents of ten remarkable HSR companies, and a rating scale is created to document the richness of each factor. Results are presented on different levels; sustainability pillars; sustainability factors; HSRs companies; and, type of indicators. Findings showed that around 34 per cent, 53 per cent and 48 per cent of the selected environmental, social and economic factors respectively are not covered in reporting practices. Some factors such as energy consumption, CO2 emissions, cost, and safety have a good representation in reports; however, reporting on these factors could be remarkably improved. In contrast, biodiversity, land use, and affordability are less popular, with inadequate reporting performance. European HSRs operators show a higher reporting performance compared to other operators. Finally, qualitative indicators are dominant compared to quantitative indicators. Another key finding is that revealed reporting variations show there is no standard set of factors that HSR companies report on today, and further, that even on the factors where there is a high level of reporting, there are standardization and normalizations issues. This research reveals areas of potential reporting improvements, plus suggesting some related indicators. Also, this study highlights the potential for the development of a common framework for HSR sustainability reporting. This framework could include currently used parameters besides new indicators to express the 26 sustainability factors. Such a framework will facilitate and ease international benchmarking exercises among HSR operators. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Though policy coherence for sustainable development ultimately depends on coherence among the SDGs – as progress toward one goal should not hamper progress toward others – synergies and trade-offs are emerging among the metrics (indicators) used to measure progress towards the various targets of the SDGs. In this context, the choice of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita as an indicator for SDG 8 (“Decent Work and Economic Growth”) contradicts the evidence that limitless economic growth is not possible on a planet with finite resources. Here, we highlight how pursuing unconditional GDP growth risks failing to achieve the SDGs overall. We show how, in the European Union, GDP is unrelated to other measures of economic performance such as levels of employment, and relates inversely to indicators of environmental sustainability and broader measures of wellbeing. Pursuing SDG 8 through a continuous increase in GDP will therefore hinder the achievement of environmental goals and goals on reducing inequalities. We propose guidelines for selecting alternative indicators for SDG 8 with the aim of improving coherence among all of the SDGs, as well as between the SDGs and other policy initiatives for sustainability. This will inform a better monitoring of SDG 8 and the definition of post-2030 Agendas for sustainable development. © 2019 The Authors},

Development of “multiculture”, “polyculture”, or “co-culture” systems along the coastal areas in Southeast Asia in turn become a preferred choice for installing future aquaculture. To build much needed knowledge guiding the design, ecological benefits, and performances of these newly explored vegetable-aquaculture systems, we designed a nested block experiment and conducted a 3-year study of cauliflower-aquaculture farming on the island. We found that farming type significantly affected the arthropod herbivores and predators, including herbivore abundance and the abundance, species richness and Shannon's diversity of the predators. More importantly, farming type had a significant effect on insecticide use, cauliflower yield and economic returns. The reduction in insecticide use promoted predator diversity and cauliflower yield in co-cultured cauliflower aquaculture as indicated by a significantly negative relationship between amount of commercial insecticides and arthropod predator diversity, as well as between amount of commercial insecticide and cauliflower yield. We conclude that co-culture practice in cauliflower-aquaculture enhanced agricultural production while decreasing use of insecticide and herbivore abundance, and increasing the abundance and diversity of predators, vegetable yield and economic value. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Crop-livestock-forest (CLFi) and crop-livestock (CLi) systems are among the most recent agricultural developments in Brazil, and aligned with the principles of cleaner production. Such integrated systems can provide at least three types of product from the same land area over a defined period. This paper presents a holistic sustainability evaluation using life cycle assessment to compare combinations of integrated and conventional systems in the Brazilian Cerrado region. The study assesses a comprehensive set of indicators in the three sustainability dimensions: environmental, economic, and social (socio-eco-efficiency). By prioritizing CLFi, the production area to meet the demand of grains, meat and energy for 500 Brazilians, from 2007 to 2014, reached 70 ha, while the conventional systems would need 420 ha to meet the same demand. This result shows that it is possible to increase production to meet the growing food global demand without the need of expanding the agricultural frontier, preserving the remaining forestland. CLFi combinations systems decreased 55% in climate change potential (2389 t of CO2 equivalent), when compared to the conventional systems. It was also observed that the more integrated systems improved the quality of employment, promoted future generation investments in society, and decreased the total production costs in 54%, when compared to conventional systems. Therefore, intensification achieved through good practices such as association, rotation, and succession by an agroforestry system, optimization of inputs (including water, energy, fertilizers, and crop protection agents), land use, soil quality, biodiversity and social aspects. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is an important factor for lake ecological environment. Under the influence of natural and human factors, LSWT is generally on the rise. LSWT is affected by lake's geographical location, climate diversity, biodiversity and cultural diversity of the plateau. To this end, the study used the natural factor (near-surface air temperature) that characterized climate change, the human factors (impermeable surface area, gross domestic product, and population) that characterized human activities, and the physical factors that characterized the lake inherent properties (lake area, watershed area, and water storage) as the dataset, and a hybrid prediction model (ε-SVR-AHP-BPANN) was proposed by combining three algorithms which were ε-support vector regression (ε-SVR), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN). This model was used to estimate and simulate the LSWT of 11 lakes in the study area from January 2018 to December 2019. Then conducted on the variation characteristics of LSWT for 11 lakes from 2001 to 2019. The results showed that: (1) The hybrid prediction model had a strong predictive power with low error and high generalization (RMSELSWT-day = 0.11, RMSELSWT-night = 0.10, RLSWT-day2 = 0.77, RLSWT-night2 = 0.90). (2) The temporal change analysis showed that, overall, the change rate of LSWT-day showed a warm-cold-warm trend from north to south in Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, while LSWT-night showed a warm-cold trend. (3) The spatial visualization analysis revealed that there was a general warming trend of LSWT, and the LSWT of northern Erhai Lake were higher than that in southern Erhai Lake, and the distribution of LSWT was regional with the change of latitude. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

It investigates the transition toward systemic and ecological approach to face the complexity of urban environment and infrastructures for energy supply. The study investigates the sustainable energy framework in Piedmont Region and in the Municipality of Turin. Especially, it analyses opportunities provided by urban rivers and streams for installing mini-hydro power plants using historical unused infrastructures. The real case study presents the conversion of an historical check dam of Regio Parco canal in a mini-hydro power plant in the city of Turin (Piedmont Region, Italy), and it investigates the “land use-water-energy nexus” from an ecological perspective. The paper considers the 12 principles of infrastructure ecology in the urban water management to provide innovative solutions for blue-urban infrastructures that increase sustainability in cities. According to the urban ecological infrastructure, the project of mini-hydro power plant presents multi-functional features and this method can be replied in other similar contexts. Concerning technical solutions adopted for the mini-hydro power plant, it examines the potential of the green/blue infrastructure approach to integrate the flood risk management and the production of renewable energy. It analyses opportunities provided by low impact development to preserve freshwater ecosystems and to maintain biodiversity using inflatable dam, Kaplan turbine and fish ladder. The “Regio Parco” mini-hydro power plant is designed to provide energy for almost 600 households improving the environmental value and the usability of the area. The paper discusses the adoption of an ecological approach to design multiple functions blue infrastructure that can be implemented on other networks improving the urban landscape. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Forest loss has severe impacts on global environment change and biodiversity. However, few studies have used panel models to analyze forest loss at the national level, attributed to the limited time-space-series data on the forest loss at such large scale. The freely accessible Landsat images provide data to derive the global forest loss at a high spatial resolution of 30 m (Hansen et al., 2013), which make it possible to carry out this study. Here we used the global forest loss dataset as a data source, a space-time panel model for 31 provinces, autonomous regions, or municipalities in mainland of China from 2000 to 2012 were built to investigate the relationship between the urbanization process and the forest loss both at the national and regional level. The results indicated that (1) the forest loss area of each province were between 3 and 89 ha to more than 89 ha during 2001 and 2012, with larger area of forest loss in the southern and north-eastern regions, while less forest loss in the central and western region. (2) In the study period, the forest loss rates were more than 4% in the southern China, while the rates were less than 0.1% in most of the northwest China; and the annual forest loss demonstrated an aggravated trend in most provinces of China. (3) There exists a scale effect and regional divergence in the impact of urbanization on forest loss: urbanization level is among the most critical factor affecting forest loss at the national level; while at the regional level, the most sensitive factor for forest loss is road mileage in the eastern region, urban green area in the central region, while urban level in the western region. This study may help to advance the understanding of the impact of urbanization process on China's forest loss, and therefore it provides good policy implications to make more effective and comprehensive solutions to reduce the loss of forests. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Urban population growth has caused significant changes in rural areas, leading to landscape modifications. These modifications affect rural systems via different mechanisms linked to alterations in land use, loss of landscape biodiversity, and habitat destruction. All these mechanism are set in motion by higher levels of global food demand, which requires increasing yields through high-input, specialised agriculture. Consequently, local food systems and food security are increasingly dependent by global food production, trade and transport. The Land Food Footprint is a suitable tool for assessing the evolution of food systems and land displacement, whereas the Shannon, Dominance and Sharpe landscape indexes jointly implemented with indicators of human disturbance and of proportion of natural area allow us to assess landscape modification and its impact on agricultural resources. In this study, we analysed the evolution of land food footprint and landscape changes in Sardinia over the period of 1970–2010 to assess whether land displacement implies landscape modifications. We also evaluated whether landscape modification entails an intensified use of resources and involves enacting changes in regional capability to satisfy the food needs of the local population. In the time series, results of landscape quantitative analysis indicate that the decrease in land food footprint balance is paired with landscape changes with a greater degree of dominance of few land uses due to agricultural specialisation in animal husbandry and abandon of marginal, less suitable and less profitable production areas. The reduced diversity of locally produced food due to the modification of food production and consumption systems is linked to modifications in traditional landscape with implications on local resources conservation. The regional land unbalance and the reduction in agricultural land capacity to support the local population food demand underline the need for food planning in the future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {China aims to realize the aspiration of sustainable development using the Circular Economy (CE) policy which, apart from other objectives, aims to minimize raw material extraction and preserve natural resources. While CE can be an important policy tool to promote more sustainable development trajectories, in practice it does not always avoid or mitigate adverse impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services caused by resource extraction and infrastructure development. Here we review the current status of biodiversity protection and CE policy in China, highlighting some of their challenges. We then explore the prospects for market-based biodiversity offsets to address the current shortcomings in existing CE policy. Finally, we propose a conceptual model that incorporates a commitment to no-net-loss mitigation into the overall CE strategy to expand the use of biodiversity offsets in China and to remove some of the deficiencies by involving private enterprises in conservation efforts. This model can be used to analyze a set of parameters for comparing different offsets against one another. We propose that such an integrative framework can help CE policy achieve the intended goal of decoupling economic growth from impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services in China. Important next steps are the implementation of case studies for target industries and ecosystems to demonstrate the synergy between CE and biodiversity offsets and evaluate on-the-ground effectiveness of the proposed integration by adapting our framework. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

This article proposes a theoretical framework that integrates ecodesign practices, methods, and tools with portfolio management during the product planning stage. For the development of this framework, a systematic analysis and literature review of both PPM and ecodesign were conducted. The framework subsequently developed was evaluated through a pilot test within two companies that develop products derived from Brazilian biodiversity. In terms of results, it presents a set of practices that are associated with the following dimensions: Guides, Methods, and Tools; Organization; and Strategy. After presenting the evaluation of the framework by the companies, practices are proposed which can be useful for the integration of ecodesign into PPM, such as adoption of the Project Management Office (PMO) and the use of social media. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Environmental, economic and social aspects of the animal production phase of beef chain have been the focus of individual studies. However, integrated assessments are lacking. Thus, this study aims to develop an approach using sustainable life cycle assessment integrated to multicriteria methods of decision-making and probabilistic weighting in order to evaluate the sustainability of four different alternatives of animal production in the southern region of the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. By presenting the integrated evaluation in a single score, the system with crop-livestock rotation (CLR) obtained a better performance. The better performance was due to the reduction in mechanization costs for planting and a high capacity of animal support per hectare without directly using phosphate and nitrogen fertilizers. However, by evaluating individual criteria, the pasture fertilization system (PFS) obtained the best performance regarding social indicators due to the high generation of jobs and worker remuneration. Probabilistic weighting in conjunction with the VIKOR (VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) multicriteria method proved to be an efficient solution to exempt human judgment from criteria weighting. This reduces the uncertainty of evaluation and allows a risk analysis considering all possible weight combinations in an integrated and individual way per criterion. However, studies on the development of new indicators related to systems, especially not evaluated criteria such as biodiversity, ecosystem services and animal welfare, are necessary to improve the evaluation of system sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Food wastes display a great potential for waste-based biorefineries in the frame of a bio-economy system. The bio-economy is an innovative economy model based on the sustainable use of renewable resources in agriculture and industry, and that takes in account biodiversity and environmental protection. To this aim, some key factors are need: the development of new technologies and processes, the identification of renewable feedstock not in competition with other production chains, the creation of new markets and competitiveness, the pushing of policymakers and stakeholders to work more closely together. Tomato industry, that is one of the most important sector of the world food industry, can display an enormous potential since it produces huge amounts of wastes. Such residues negatively impact on the sustainability of food industry, since their disposal represents one main issue in terms of environmental and economic impact. Nevertheless, they represent a cheap and renewable biomass that, in the frame of the biorefinery model, could be exploited for the production of chemicals and energy thus contributing to the sustainability of this production chain. In this paper the potentiality of the tomato-wastes biorefinery was investigated with particular regard to the Italian scenario. Some main aspects were investigated including the possible re-use strategies and the available examples of tomato wastes conversion into marketable products. The analysis of the state of the art showed that tomato wastes recycling in Italy is till limited. Indeed, the scalability of such processes at an industrial scale still remains to be assessed in order to open the way to new markets based on the exploitation of tomato wastes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

This corresponds to a 92% decrease of greenhouse gas emissions from Swedish consumption from today's level. The four scenarios illustrate different strategies: 1) collaborative economy, 2) local self-sufficiency, 3) automation for quality of life and 4) circular economy in the welfare state. The aim is to further hone and quantify the scenario narratives with a focus on greenhouse gas emissions occurring as a result of Swedish consumption, both private and public. The results show that the climate target can be met in all scenarios but this requires radical sector-specific as well as general changes, including decarbonisation, technology development, increased efficiencies, innovative practices and reduced demand. The mix of these strategies varies for different sectors and different scenarios, but all are needed to reach the climate goals. As we assume that Sweden is fossil-free 2050, particular areas of attention are diets, travel, emission intensities in other countries and the level of imports. Potential implications for other environmental goals, land use and biodiversity as well as the potential magnitude of negative emissions technologies, although uncertain and limited, that could offset some additional greenhouse gas emissions are discussed. © 2019},

	abstract = {Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a staple food for three billion people and paddy fields contribute greatly to greenhouse gases (GHG) emission and environmental nitrogen losses. Rice paddies need to be managed in a novel and sustainable way to promote production. Here, we critically review the potential benefits and constrains of a novel rice production system, the co-culture of rice and aquatic animals. The review helps to answer important questions: how would the co-culture affect farm profitability, water quality, and GHG emission? What are the major benefits and constraints for adopting the co-culture system? The review revealed that rice-animal co-culture provided ecological, economic, and social benefits such as increasing farm productivity and greater resource utilization efficiencies, and that the system could increase biodiversity, improve water and soil quality, and reduce GHG emissions. However, despite its potential benefits, the adoption of the system has been constrained by the lack of science-based extension programs and the farmers’ concerns over drought-related production risks. Moreover, misusing the system by adopting unpractically high culture density (high animal feed input) and/or in undesirable field conditions may lead to deteriorating water quality and lowering farm profitability. The review suggests that more research is needed to evaluate the impacts of the rice-animal co-culture system under variable climate and field conditions and to identify factors controlling their negative impacts. Furthermore, a strong extension program, with policy and technological guidance from the government and non-governmental organizations, is needed to achieve the wide adoption of the co-culture practice. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Colombian government included gold mining as one of the drivers of development for the period 2014–2018. Large-scale gold mining is expanding due mainly to international investors attracted by the government. Small-scale and artisanal mining is also expanding, mainly because of increasing gold prices. This expansion of gold mining activities can have considerable consequences for the environment, as it can lead to more pollution and environmental degradation, posing a threat to the natural ecosystems and the health of the communities living in gold mining areas. This literature review analyzes the main challenges of the gold mining sector in Colombia from the environmental and social perspective, as well as initiatives developed to cope with these challenges and the opportunities to carry out more sustainable gold mining activities in the country. The main environmental challenges of the gold mining sector in Colombia are the pollution of natural ecosystems through the generation of solid waste, emissions of mercury during gold amalgamation, and greenhouse gas emissions. To cope with these challenges, reclamation of waste deposits is being conducted through silviculture, agriculture and reforestation. Furthermore, mercury reduction technologies have been adopted in gold mining areas and trials for remediation of polluted ecosystems are being conducted. The main social challenges of the gold mining sector are high levels of poverty, illegality and violence of communities living in the gold mining areas, as well as high levels of informality of gold mining. To cope with these challenges, the communities are being actively involved in the reclamation schemes of gold mining companies in many areas of the country with the aim to restore their livelihoods and improve their wellbeing. Moreover, elements of corporate social responsibility are being implemented to compensate for the loss of livelihoods, health effects and other social consequences of gold mining activities. To achieve a more sustainable gold mining production in the country, it is necessary to develop a framework for sustainability assessments to support decision making in the sector. Efforts need to be made to improve resource-use efficiency and biodiversity protection. From the social perspective, corporate social responsibility practices should be strengthened, especially towards understanding the needs of the local communities and the creation of mechanisms of participation that could help to prevent social conflicts around gold mining areas. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Although large-scale mining companies have embraced environmental sustainability, the drivers and the mechanisms for addressing their impacts throughout the mine life cycle is not fully understood because of the limited research in this area. The focus in this study involves an examination of the drivers for environmental sustainability in a weak and non-enabling institutional context and the mechanisms for addressing impacts on biodiversity, water quality and quantity, and ambient climate. The findings show that the environmental sustainability practices of multinational mining companies are determined by regulatory compliance and corporate environmental responsibility based on perceived ethical obligation. Additionally, we find gaps in mine closure planning and rehabilitation because of the limited requirement for biodiversity restoration in the domains of flora repopulation and active fauna reintroduction.

	abstract = {In an increasingly saturated global market, winegrowers and wineries have an opportunity for product differentiation born out of environmental and social pressures coupled with growing consumer preferences. The wine industry has seen significant establishment of sustainable certification systems as wine consumers preferences for sustainability have developed. However, there is a risk that the prominent use of symbol and icon type labels may obscure individual sustainability attributes and weaken signalling to consumers searching for specific credentials. Consumers may respond to individual components of sustainability programs differently to others and the use of simplistic symbols and logos makes it difficult for consumers to identify which elements are contained within a scheme. This paper reports on the application of a discrete choice experiment to identify and measure Californian Sauvignon blanc consumer preferences for individual components of sustainability schemes active in-market. A specific objective is to assess the relative importance of sustainability attributes in consumers wine choice against those widely recognised to be influences on choice, namely country-of-origin, price, and quality. Results demonstrate that the presence of sustainability attributes can influence Sauvignon blanc choice and that consumers have a significant positive willingness-to-pay for several of these attributes. Consistent with current understanding we find that price is a core attribute, and that willingness-to-pay varies considerably over where a wine is made and the critic score a wine receives. What this study adds to this narrative is that the role of sustainability in wine consumer choices is significantly determined by specific environmental and social outcomes. Growers and wineries implementing sustainability programs or considering market strategies incorporating sustainability may benefit from increasing attention on attributes more valued by consumers such as management of pests and diseases, and water resources, and less on attributes less valued such as energy or biodiversity management. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In times of climate change, biodiversity loss, or growing natural resource scarcity, the circular business model (CBM) concept is increasingly attractive, promoting the reorganization of current value creation architectures and supply chains toward a sustainable system of production and consumption. Driven by a vision of continued economic expansion and growth on a planet with finite natural resources, CBMs are endorsed by political institutions, multinational corporations, business consultancies, and academia. Some argue that CBM configurations contribute to a more holistic and radical change in the existing business logics than approaches that achieve incremental resource efficiency improvements. However, how “holistic” and “radical” are CBMs theoretically constituted in academia if we consider the deep structural and paradigmatic shifts in societies necessary to deal with the challenges associated with the Anthropocene? Prior studies do not examine the inherent normative settings and the operational change approaches beneath CBM concepts. To reconstruct the theoretical foundations of CBMs critically, the recent CBM body of academic literature is systematically reviewed according to (1) the legitimacy of CBMs (why should it be done) (2) the modes of value creation and offerings (what should be done), and (3) the core principles of CBM integration into daily business (how should it be done). From this synthesis, the predominant notion of sustainability behind the CBM concept can be revealed. This study argues contemporary scientifically constructed CBMs need to be reconsidered if they are intended to contribute to a profound economic transition toward sustainability. Hence, the paper shows how principles from more “holistic”, “radical”, and pluralistic economic approaches can widen CBMs and how future research can help to diversify the concept. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In October 2018, the European Union (EU) launched an updated bioeconomy strategy with the aim of encouraging the substitution of fossil carbon with biomass feedstock in the industry and in energy production while preserving ecosystem services. The objective of the paper is to analyse the links between the EU bioeconomy strategy and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and to assess what could be the main points of synergies and tensions between bioeconomy-related SDG targets. By semantically mapping the action plan of the 2018 EU bioeconomy strategy with the SDG targets, the paper finds that the bioeconomy strategy is aligned with 53 targets distributed in 12 of the 17 SDGs. Ex-post correlation analysis on bioeconomy-related SDGs indicators for 28 EU Member States (1990–2018) shows a predominance of synergies over trade-offs. More intense synergetic past developments (positive correlations) are found among clean energies (SDG 7), recycling (SDG 11), ecosystem preservation (SDG 15) and most of all other bioeconomy-related SDGs. Negative correlations are observed between agro-biodiversity (SDG 2), domestic material consumption of biomass (SDG 8 and 12), agriculture and industrial developments (SDG 2 and SDG 9) and a wide array of bioeconomy-related SDG indicators. The hotspots of strong correlations identified might be useful in further enrichment of ex-ante simulation models. From a policy coherence perspective, a wide range of policy instruments are already in place in the EU to foster synergies and may bring co-benefits. Policies oriented at preventing trade-offs are already in place but they have not overcome the antagonisms observed in this study yet. Change in practices, technical and technological innovations and the application of circular and ‘cascading principles’ are the most common fields of action. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {                             International trade of soybeans has increased substantially over recent decades. Its environmental toll is routinely linked to deforestation and biodiversity loss. However, soybean trade also imposes a huge demand on water and land resources, in individual countries and globally. Such a burden, and its underlying sectoral drivers, is frequently overlooked within the current research and policy agenda around sustainable soybean supply chains. This study evaluates the Virtual Water Trade (VWT) and Virtual Land Trade (VLT) of global soybean trade and reveals which countries and sectors are responsible. Soybean-related VWT and VLT are estimated by combining physical import and export data and associated resource use information from 166 countries during the period 2000–2016. Over this period global virtual soybean-related virtual water and land trade grew by 298% and 250% respectively. In 2016, 812 Gm                             3                              of water use and 41 Mha of land use was directly embodied in international soybean trade. This corresponds to one-third of water and land used to grow soybean globally. Soybean-related VWT and VLT was mainly driven by demand in China, the Netherlands and Brazil, for soybean grown in the US, Brazil and Argentina. Animal feed is responsible for around three-quarters of this resource use. A reduction in the consumption of animal products or switching to direct human consumption of soybeans would reduce the overall demand for soybean production and associated resource use. Although welcome, calls for deforestation-free soybean supply chains do not go far enough to reduce the large, global water and land demand of soybean trade. The research and policy agenda around soybean trade warrants a broader focus on water and land use and whether this represents an efficient, and logical, allocation of resources within the context of food provision and national resource security.                          © 2019},

Thus, are imperative that natural areas be explored under sustainable precepts, respecting and stimulating, the resilience and resistance of the ecosystems. To examine the relation of sustainable companies and the ecosystem services, we investigated all companies listed in the Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) of Brazilian stock exchange (B3), considered as having as best sustainable practices of the Brazilian market. We analyzed if corporations dependently of provisioned ecosystem services recognizes the importance of sustainable practices for restocking the ecosystem services of natural areas that they explored. Data were collected reading socio-environmental reports. The LIFE certification methodology (Lasting Initiative for Earth) was used as guide-reading, making possible qualify and quantify the externalities and mitigations of each company. From seven companies examined, six not developed sufficient actions to mitigate their externalities. One company, from the forest sector, mitigated 40% of entire externalities calculated for all companies. Therefore, introduce biodiversity conservation actions in management systems contributes to achieving sustainable principles and the environmental conscious exploration. Additionally, the LIFE methodology can be used to improve sustainable policies of companies, mitigating their externalities, and approximating companies to achieve more easily the Paris Agreement through recompose the ecosystem services. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {                             Demolished marble and ceramic clay tiles waste management are one of the greatest concerns for sustainable development nowadays. The reason behind that chemical components of these two substances create a serious threat to the biodiversity. Consequently, this study aims to find the scope of applying marble and ceramic clay tiles wastes as green materials through immobilizing the potential contaminants in the structural bond of concrete and mortar. In favour of this, four widely used compositions such as 1:1:2 (OPC: FA: CA), 1:1.5:3, 1:2:4 and 1:3:6 for concrete specimens as well as 1:1 (OPC: FA), 1:1.5, 1:2 and 1:3 for mortar were selected as surrogate composition, where both wastes was substituted by 20% of the total volume of both natural aggregates. The study analyzed the relationship between the engineering characteristics of monolithic matrices and migration behavior of Ca                             2+                              and Mg                             2+                             , which are abundantly available in the adopted demolished aggregates. The research revealed that releasing content of Ca                             2+                              and Mg                             2+                              from the representative samples increased with the increase of demolished aggregate content, void space and water absorption ratio, as well as with the reduction in compressive strength, density and coefficient of permeability. Furthermore, the combination 1:3:6 for concrete and 1:3 for mortar specimens showed that the total transport content of Ca                             2+                              and Mg                             2+                              exceeded the standard for disposal in the earth surface in static and hydraulic pressure leaching test and not safe for land disposal. The remaining employed mixtures of both cases exhibited the satisfactory level with non-pollutant in which entrapment of the measured ions ranged from 99.5% to 97.2%.

However, the potential of multi-trophic-level production systems, such as the co-culture of vegetables, flowers and aquatic animals, has received little attention. We performed a two-year experiment comparing multispecies (cauliflower, taro, flowers and aquatic animals) co-culture, and mono-cauliflower farming practices on the Chongming Eco-island of China. The abundance of herbivorous insects and their predators, pesticide input and cauliflower yield were recorded. The results indicated that multispecies co-culture decreased the abundance of insect herbivores by 19.9–26.0% and thus decreased pesticide use by 22.2–30.0%. Meanwhile, we found that co-culture of crops, flowers and aquatic animals increased the abundance (29.5–34.1%), and species diversity of invertebrate predators (3.3–3.8%), and increased cauliflower yield (6.9–7.5%). There were significant positive relationships between the abundance, species richness (or diversity) of arthropod predators and cauliflower yield. Multispecies co-culture has great potential to promote ecological intensification of vegetable production and the associated ecosystem services. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

EIA is a mandatory decision support tool for environmental authorities to approve sugarcane ethanol projects, and the Bonsucro certification is a voluntary scheme that aims to demonstrate to external stakeholders the performance of sugarcane ethanol industry on sustainability issues. The objective of this research is to analyze the environmental, social and economic issues addressed in the Bonsucro certification that could be included in Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) – the technical report of EIA process – in order to extend EIA to the non-environmental dimensions and thus strengthen its contribution for sustainability in the sugarcane ethanol sector. The Brazilian context was chosen because the country is a pivotal producer of sugarcane, and whose production practices are continuously subject to the scrutiny of the international markets and academia. This is an applied research based on an exploratory-descriptive approach, employing a multi-case study in which data collection was accomplished by gathering document data, as well as semi-structured interviews with key sources and actors from the Brazilian sugarcane ethanol industry. Although most themes concerning the sustainability of the sugarcane ethanol sector are recognized in both instruments, some relevant sustainability issues are not included in either of the two and included in one but not in the other. As expected the main similarities between these two instruments are largely related to environmental issues – soil and water; biodiversity; emissions and effluents and recycling of waste – while differences can be observed in the economic and social dimensions. Promotion of energy efficiency was seldom included as a criterion in the EISs, whereas production and process efficiency, training for employees, quality of products and research and expertise were criteria completely absent from the EISs. We conclude that harmonizing the topics covered by the EIS and the Bonsucro certification would result in advantages: helping to mainstream sustainability within the lifecycle of the sugarcane production and to address some relevant social and economic issues within EIA processes in the sugarcane ethanol sector. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

For this purpose, a qualitative study based on interviews with 39 environmental managers, auditors, consultants and other experts in the field was conducted. The findings show that the adoption of new standards for biodiversity management is essentially driven by the need to improve the social acceptability of activities that can have a significant impact on natural habitats. The possible benefits of certification, particularly in terms of stakeholder relationships, and the difficulty of measuring the intangible aspects of biodiversity issues are also discussed. The study contributes to the emerging literature on organizational biodiversity management and to the debates on the symbolic versus substantial adoption of certifiable environmental standards.

	abstract = {In recent decades, conventional intensive agricultural practices have led to serious non-point-source pollution in China and have imposed serious ecological threats to agroecosystems, especially in ecologically sensitive areas. The Middle Line of the South-to-North Water Diversion project, which covers one of the largest ecologically sensitive areas in China, began in December 2014. In the study area around the Danjiangkou Reservoir belonging to the Middle Line of the South-to-North Water Diversion project, organic farming has been encouraged instead of conventional farming. This study aimed to measure the difference in ecological safety between conventional and organic farming based on the ecological footprint combined with life cycle assessment, which integrated the assessments of carbon footprint (CF), water footprint (WF) and nitrogen footprint (NF). This paper hypothesized that the ecological footprint of organic farming in the target area would be lower than that of conventional farming because of the reduced chemical inputs. The results showed that, as expected, first, organic farming had a lower footprint with a higher ecological remainder than conventional farming in 2015, indicating that organic farming practices made greater contributions to regional ecological safety in the study area. Second, in conventional farming, the total grey water footprint (nitrogen, phosphorus pentoxide and potassium oxide) was much higher than that of the farms in which only nitrogen fertilizer were used, indicating that both phosphorus pentoxide and potassium oxide also play indispensable roles in water footprint evaluation. Third, the energy-related nitrogen footprint was greatest in organic farming, caused by higher diesel oil consumption due to greater farm size for mechanical operation. Finally, the methods of calculating the amount of ecological compensation were improved. According to reduced ecological footprints, an extra payment (CF = 115.17 CNY ha−1; WF = 0.09 CNY ha−1; NF = 102.20 CNY ha−1) for organic farming should be seriously considered by different stakeholders, due to its benefit to greater ecological safety. From the perspective of ecological footprints, ecological compensation policies for organic farming might effectively promote ecological safety in the South-to-North Water Diversion watershed in the future. Footprint, as an accounting tool, offers great potential in assessment of ecological safety and ecological compensation worldwide and needs to be further explored in more dimensions such as phosphorus footprint, biodiversity footprint and so on. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Sustainability depends on the adoption of attitudes by the productive sector to achieve cleaner production processes. Earth provides the resources necessary for life, but the anthropic concept of survival is inserted in acts of consumption and production to meet the demand that hinder the achievement of sustainability itself. On the other hand, both the supply chain and the end consumer need information which may assist decision-making about buying products that do not harm the environment. The conscious consumption is a growing practice worldwide and manufacturers should adopt a proactive approach to monitor pollution and the impacts caused by their products. Aquatic ecotoxicity can affect multiple trophic levels, compromising water quality for both human consumption and ecosystems biodiversity. Since water is an essential resource for life, this study proposes a method for calculating the Water Ecotoxicological Footprint of products and presents an illustrative example of application to achieve a single indicator that can be used in comparative assessments or benchmarking. Obtained by quantifying tangible variables in a system of monitoring, management of water use and disposal of effluent (wastewater) in industrial and agricultural environments, this indicator aims to contribute to the decision-making process towards sustainability since it may be showed as an informative label on the packaging of each product answering the question: “How much does this product contribute to the aquatic ecotoxicity?” or “How much does this product contribute to the loss of biodiversity?”. From a product life-cycle perspective, the spatial and temporal dimensions were inserted by using a geographic information system (GIS) for local assessments. Public policies can be established to encourage the identification and mitigation of aquatic ecotoxicity impact throughout the product supply chain. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Energy production by power plants causes nitrogen emissions that may affect nature areas. To assess the impact of power plants on the biodiversity of Natura 2000 areas and to estimate compensation costs, we developed an analytical framework and applied it to four single power plants in the Netherlands. These plants differed according to production capacity and fuel source (natural gas and biomass). The plants affected between 77 and 537 km2 of Natura 2000 nature areas. To estimate cost of biodiversity loss and compensation, three approaches were applied: costs of restoration, ‘insetting’ costs incurred by creating new nature areas within the current Natura 2000 network, and offsetting costs, including land purchase of former agricultural land. Depending on the nitrogen exceedance levels of vegetation, compensation areas ranged between 6.5 and 23.6 ha. The estimated total cost per power plant varied from € 38,430 to € 1,753,261 annually. Depending on the cost method applied, biodiversity cost of energy production by single power plants ranged from 0.06 €.MWh−1 to 1.65 €.MWh−1. This cost largely depends on the type and location of the vegetation affected, which indicates that a spatial analysis is needed to measure the biodiversity footprint of business operations in environmental reporting. © 2019},

	abstract = {Ecosystems and biodiversity provide many critical life support functions including clean water, food, climate regulation, and recreational services. Despite its significant values biodiversity in Pakistan is being lost at a significant rate particularly due to agriculture intensification. The intensive agriculture system leading to serious environmental damages including biodiversity loss, water pollution, soil degradation, disruption of carbon sink and increase in GHG emissions. There is a growing recognition of promoting Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) strategies in smallholder agriculture; however, there is limited information about the existing EbA strategies by smallholder farmers and factors that influence the adoption of these practices. This article addresses research gap by using a survey data of 360 households from three districts of Pakistan. We explored existing EbA practices used by farmers and factors associated with the use of these practices. The list of ecosystem-based adaptation practices (EbA) was created on the basis of literature review and with the assistance of expert opinions. This study identified a number of risks associated with ecosystem degradation as perceived by smallholder farmers such as salinization, water pollution, soil erosion and decline in crop productivity. Due to overexploitation of underground water and extensive use of external inputs for agriculture use, the majority of farmers reported decline in water quality and depth of the underground water table. We used a double hurdle model for adoption and intensity of adaptation practices. The results show that farmers' social capital and institutional access increase the probability and intensity of adoption of EbA practices. The study suggests that a majority of smallholder farmers in Pakistan are already using certain EbA strategies, but there is still scope for larger implementation. Institutional policies and non-government organizations (NGOs) can increase broader use of EbA strategies by facilitating farmers’ access to subsidized tree nurseries, farmer-to-farmer information and promoting EbA policies in different socioeconomic and agro-ecological context. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Consumers are increasingly demanding products containing palm oil produced without harm to the environment. The industry response to this demand has been the creation of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and the development of a certification system to ensure sustainable palm oil production. However, currently there is no scientific evidence of the benefit gained through the RSPO certification schema. This paper quantifies the environmental impacts of RSPO certified and non-certified through a detailed Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of 1 kg of RBD palm oil to factory gate, produced in Indonesia and Malaysia in 2016, to identify potential benefits and trade-offs of RSPO certification. The ISO 14040/14044 compliant LCA is carried out following both a consequential and an attributional LCA approach. The inventory model presents a high level of detail. Primary inventory data describing the certified production system are obtained from RSPO assessment reports, covering 73% (634 estates) of the certified estate, including 111 smallholders, and 58% (165 oil mills) of the certified mills. Data for the total industrial production are drawn from national statistics and scientific literature. The non-certified flows are derived by subtracting the certified flows from the total industry flows. The consequential results show that RSPO certified oil reduces GHG emission by 35% compared to non-certified i.e. 3.41 (2.61–4.48) kg CO2 eq./kg for certified vs 5.34 (3.34–8.16) kg CO2 eq./kg for non-certified. Based on a thorough data quality assessment and uncertainty analysis, this result is deemed sufficiently robust and thus conclusive. Certified production achieves the largest GHG emissions reduction because of higher yields, i.e. less land use per unit of product, less oil palm cultivated on peat soil and higher share of palm oil mill effluents treated with biogas capture technologies. We also found that nature occupation is reduced by 20% in certified production while respiratory inorganic is slightly higher (3%) in certified production, due to the larger use of fertilisers. For other impact categories, results are associated with a larger uncertainty and therefore shall be considered as indicative. Similar results are found in attributional modelling. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Islands are threatened by various natural and anthropogenic factors including climate change, overpopulation, unsustainable use of natural resources and increasing trend in seismic events. Therefore, studies on island in specific aspect (ecological, social and economic) is very essential for sustainable resource management and future development. Mangroves are highly important natural resources of coastal regions in respect to coastal livelihood and natural defense. Although, around 46% of the mangrove forest area has vanished worldwide in the last few decades. In this present research, Future Mangrove Suitability Index (FMSI) using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method has been performed for sustainable forest management under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal no 15. It is a new framework applied on North and Middle Andaman Island to determine the future distribution of mangrove forest. Land-use and land-covers (LULC) are prepared in supervised classification (maximum likelihood algorithm) techniques with 3000 signatures. A total number of fourteen parameters has been used in multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) platform to generate future scenarios. Among them, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) projected climatic data (RCP 6.0 scenario shows the best result comparing to 4.5 and 8.5) and projected population data has been used for the first time in the investigated area. The final results are validated using 556 field sample point. Seven major sensitive parameters have been selected from sensitivity analysis and three statistical correlation analysis has been performed using 300 field points to generate the actual correlation between the parameters. The final outcome shows that major unsuitable zones are located in Diglipur tehsil whereas; highest suitable zones are located in Rangat tehsil region which are the result of the continuous increase of sea surface height (1.5 mm observed during 1980–2009), seismic events with frequent storm surges, anthropogenic influences and impact of climate change. Thus a planned sustainable development practice is essential to control the biodiversity loss and future livelihood management. Moreover, this study will strengthen future planning projects and researches in mangrove ecosystem management of Andaman. © 2019},

This reflects an innovative trend towards using narratives in social and management sciences, which needs to be replicated by other disciplines, organisations, agencies, and social groupings. In this paper, focus is on identifying storylines, phrases, myths, and local and indigenous knowledge systems of ethical and ecological significance. Using examples from written and unwritten narratives of Hausa – one of the widely spoken languages in sub-Saharan Africa, this study shines light on some key narratives relevant to present day critical environmental issues such as management of agricultural landscapes, municipal waste, ecosystem services, integrated natural resource management, and biodiversity loss. Environmental ethics drawn from the narratives provide an integrated platform where formal and informal institutions of sustainability can be strengthened, supporting transformation towards sustainability through enhancing ecological consciousness, skills, and attitudes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

The index is a composite indicator with 5 dimensions and 25 indicators. The dimensions are airport services and quality, energy consumption and generation, carbon dioxide emissions and mitigation planning, environmental management and biodiversity, and atmosphere and low emission transport. The index is applied to a sample of 9 airports that take place among the busiest and best airports in the world based on passenger traffic and passenger satisfaction. Data is mined from Corporate Sustainability Reports and related sources. Amsterdam Schiphol, Frankfurt, Munich, Istanbul Atatürk, and London Heathrow airports are the top 5 airports in the sample. The linear regression between the results of the index and annual passenger traffic is found to be 0.1942. The results can be used to benchmark progress in decoupling airport operations from greater environmental impact. The paper provides recommendations for the 5 dimensions of the index based on best practices from the airports in the sample. The index is useful to allow airport managers to coordinate strategies for the sustainable development of energy, water, and environment systems in airports and lift-off towards more sustainable airport practices. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {An environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was performed to compare four typical milk production systems of the Po Valley: drinking milk (A); Parmigiano-Reggiano more intensive (B); Parmigiano-Reggiano less intensive (C) and Grana Padano (D). The input and output data were collected directly from the farmers by way of questionnaires. The results indicated that the total GHG emissions from the analysed farms, with biological allocation, were: 1.47, 1.35, 1.49 and 1.50 kg CO2 eq. kg-1 FPCM (Fat Protein Corrected Milk) for farm A, B, C and D respectively. Excluding Land Use Change (LUC) emissions and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) sequestration, total GHG emissions were reduced to 1.02, 1.11, 1.26 and 1.20 kg CO2 eq. kg-1 FPCM for farm A, B, C and D respectively. These reductions were mostly due to the GHG emissions associated to the LUC from imported soybean meal, while the contribution of SOC sequestration to the total GHG emissions was found to be negligible. When LUC emissions from imported soybean meal were not included in the analysis, lower GHG emissions were associated to higher milk yield, feed self-sufficiency and feed efficiency. However, when LUC emissions were included in the analysis, the highest level of these parameters did not always lead to a reduction of the total GHG emissions because the higher use of maize silage was associated with an increase in the use of imported soymeal. The results of this LCA also indicated that marine eutrophication, freshwater eutrophication, non-renewable energy use, land occupation and total biodiversity loss decreased as the level of intensification of the production system increased. Conversely, local biodiversity loss, instead, increased if the milk yield per cow increased. We can conclude that, in the specific context analysed, the increase in productivity may lead to a trade-off between global impacts (such as GHG emissions) and local impacts (e.g. local biodiversity and eutrophication). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {In the debate surrounding the sustainable future of food, claims like “buy local” are widespread in publications and the media, supported by the discourse that buying “local food” provides ecological, health and socio-economic benefits. Recognising the lack of scientific evidence for this claim, this paper aims to compare the results of sustainability assessments for 14 local and global food products in four sectors within four European countries. Each sector has been analysed independently using sustainability indicators across five dimensions of sustainability: environmental, economic, social, health and ethics. In order to determine if local products generally perform better, an outranking analysis was conducted to rank the products relative to their sustainability performance. Outranking is a multi-criteria decision aid method that allows comparison of alternatives based on quantitative and qualitative indicators at different scales. Each product is also characterized by a degree of localness in order to relate sustainability and localness. The results are given in the form of phi flows, which are relative preference scores of one product compared to other ones in the same sector. The rankings showed that global products consistently come last in terms of sustainability, even when the preference functions and weighting of the indicators were varied. The first positions of the rankings were taken either by the most local or an intermediary product. Moreover, detailed rankings at the attribute level showed the relative strengths and weaknesses of each food product along the local-global continuum. It appeared that the strength of local and intermediary products was mainly in health and socio-economic dimensions, particularly aspects of care and links to the territory such as biodiversity, animal welfare, governance or resilience. In relation to global food products, they presented substantial advantages in terms of climate change mitigation and affordability to consumers. This contrasts with the food-miles ecological claim. Thus, we conclude that distance is not the most critical factor in improving sustainability of food products, and that other criteria of localness (identity, governance or size) play a more critical role. © 2017},

	abstract = {The increasing pressures to conserve biodiversity—particularly for industries based on the exploitation of natural resources—have reinforced the need to implement specific measures in this area. Corporate commitment to preserving biodiversity is increasingly scrutinized by stakeholders and now represents an important aspect of business ethics. Although stakeholder involvement is often essential to the management of biodiversity, very few studies in the literature have focused on the details of this involvement. The objective of this paper is to analyze how mining and forestry companies can manage biodiversity issues through stakeholder involvement based on a content analysis of 430 sustainability reports using the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework. The paper elucidates the reasons for such involvement, the nature of stakeholders involved, and the types of measures employed to manage biodiversity. Stakeholders’ motives for becoming involved revolve around four main issues: complexity and knowledge management; self-regulation and relationships with public authorities; legitimacy and social responsiveness; and commercial and strategic objectives. The stakeholders involved in biodiversity initiatives are essentially non-governmental organizations, experts and universities, public authorities, and coalitions of companies. In the end, the initiatives identified can be grouped into three categories: management practices, socio-political actions, and research and conservation measures. The paper provides various examples of these initiatives and shows how they can be implemented in collaboration with different stakeholders depending on the company’s objectives. The contributions the study makes to the literature on biodiversity management and the managerial implications of the study are analyzed in the discussion section. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {Concerns over climate change and the security of industrial feedstock supplies have been opening a growing market for biobased materials. This development, however, also presents a challenge to scientists, policy makers, and industry because the production of biobased materials requires land and is typically associated with adverse environmental effects. This article addresses the environmental impacts of biobased materials in a meta-analysis of 44 life cycle assessment (LCA) studies. The reviewed literature suggests that one metric ton (t) of biobased materials saves, relative to conventional materials, 55 ± 34 gigajoules of primary energy and 3 ± 1 t carbon dioxide equivalents of greenhouse gases. However, biobased materials may increase eutrophication by 5 ± 7 kilograms (kg) phosphate equivalents/t and stratospheric ozone depletion by 1.9 ± 1.8 kg nitrous oxide equivalents/t. Our findings are inconclusive with regard to acidification (savings of 2 ± 20 kg sulfur dioxide equivalents/t) and photochemical ozone formation (savings of 0.3 ± 2.4 kg ethene equivalents/t). The variability in the results of life cycle assessment studies highlights the difficulties in drawing general conclusions. Still, common to most biobased materials are impacts caused by the application of fertilizers and pesticides during industrial biomass cultivation. Additional land use impacts, such as the potential loss of biodiversity, soil carbon depletion, soil erosion, deforestation, as well as greenhouse gas emissions from indirect land use change are not quantified in this review. Clearly these impacts should be considered when evaluating the environmental performance of biobased materials. © 2012 by Yale University.},

	abstract = {The forestry process in Japan, from plantation stage to wood biomass production, was assessed using a process-based ecological model, forestry cost calculation model, and an ecological footprint-like index. In order to estimate ecosystem dynamics under various forest management practices, the ecosystem model simulated material cycles. The cost calculation model estimated the economic cost for each stage of woody biomass (wood chip) production. An occupancy rate time index (ORT) was defined by a 200-year usage span for land, material, pollution and labor against the amount available for woody biomass production. The models and the index were combined and four forest management scenarios were evaluated on a community scale in Japan: business as usual (BAU), a forest management recommended by the local government to enhance and improve forest management to include woody biomass production; FM1, modified practices; FM2, extended practices; and CNV, converting part of a plantation into natural broadleaf forest under the FM2 scenario, considering the biodiversity of the forests. The results for long-term simulations revealed that the current forest management (BAU and FM1) was not efficient in the production of woody biomass in terms of economic cost and ORT. The FM2 scenario modified from the FM1 scenario would produce ecological and economical improvements, but integrated assessment by using ORT indicated an increase in carbon emissions and labor due to enhanced forest practices. Woody biomass production under the FM2 scenario needs to be supported by carbon offsetting, such as reduction of coal combustion in thermal power plants. Under the CNV scenario, ORT values were the same as those under BAU and FM1 if the carbon offset was considered. The CNV scenario was found to be the best, considering the impact on ecological and social systems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Urban parks improve quality of life by providing an array of cultural and natural ecosystem services, such as maintaining biodiversity, reducing air pollution, and benefiting residents’ physical and mental states. Although government invests a large amount of capital into park management, parks are still underused in many cases. In this study, the association and relative importance of socio-demographic, environmental, and individual factors were investigated with regards to their impact on citizens’ park visitation. Data was collected through cross-sectional door-to-door questionnaires and online databases, and was analyzed using a hierarchical regression model. Results showed that physical exercise (27.4% of collected reports) and rest and relaxation (26.7%) were the two most widespread reasons for park use. When asked about constraints of park visitation, time limitations were reported as being the most constraining factor. However, our quantitative analysis found no significant correlation. Socio-demographic, environmental, and individual variables explained 1%, 20% and 26% (adjusted R2) of the total variance in frequency of park visitation between participants, respectively. A citizen's neighborhood greenspace, housing price, and distance from the nearest park were negatively correlated with park use. Among individual factors, a participant's reported affinity for park visits, time spent in their residential greenspace, and number of children under seven were positively correlated with park visitation, with a decreasingβcoefficient. This research highlights the predominant contribution of attitude over accessibility factors when it comes to park visitation. Furthermore, the data indicates that accessibility factors function differently for frequent, infrequent, and moderate park users and provision with parks within 1000 m of their home is recommended. The findings have implications for park management and future research. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd},

Using this new tool, it should be possible to label every commodity, service and natural resource with the share it claims of the Earth's surface. This, in turn, can enable the integration of natural limits into the economy through the complete internalization of costs within market prices, while also reducing resource throughput fairly and quickly without an undue loss in GNP. The six procedures are as follows: First, operating within the boundaries of the sustainable local yields of the biologically productive soil and water areas, without any input of non-renewable resources, particularly fossil fuels; Second, taking spatial variations of this yield into account; Third, considering only sustainable CO2-sinks; Fourth, including every exploitation of nature, for instance all material flows; Fifth, taking care of intertemporal effects and depletion; and sixth, preserving the natural habitats necessary for the survival of biodiversity, bearing the species/area relationship in mind. © 2011 by the authors.},

Using state-level data for all 48 contiguous states, biodiversity risk is measured using a Modified Index (MODEX). This index is an adaptation of a comprehensive National Biodiversity Risk Assessment Index. The MODEX differs from other measures in that it is takes into account the impact of human activities and conservation measures. The econometric approach includes corrections for spatial autocorrelation effects, which are present in the data. Modeling estimation results do not support the EKC hypothesis for biodiversity risk in the US. This finding is robust over ordinary least squares, spatial error, and spatial lag models, where the latter is shown to be the preferred model. Results from the spatial lag regression show that a 1% increase in human population density is associated with about a 0.19% increase in biodiversity risk. Spatial dependence in this case study explains 30% of the variation, as risk in one state spills over into adjoining states. From a policy perspective, this latter result supports the need for coordinated efforts at state and federal levels to address the problem of biodiversity loss. © 2011 by the authors.},

This paper describes the social context in which local conservation is conducted in a natural protected area in Yucatan, Mexico. In particular, it examines the agreement and expectations among local stakeholders on the main goals the reserve should achieve. Through participatory observation and semi-structured interviews, we analyzed the perceptions on conservation of the five groups relevant to the area management: 1) local people; 2) conservation government agency; 3) scientists; 4) non-governmental organization, and 5) a tourist agency. All actors agreed that the protected area should fulfill two main goals: i) to conserve biodiversity and, ii) to improve local welfare and development. In general, ecotourism is perceived as the best option for protecting the forest and promoting local development. Traditional agriculture, on the other hand, is perceived as the main conservation threat, but recognized as a crucial component of local wellbeing.

	abstract = {Land use is recognized as a pervasive driver of environmental impacts, including climate change and biodiversity loss. Global trade leads to "telecoupling" between the land use of production and the consumption of biomass-based goods and services. Telecoupling is captured by accounts of the upstream land requirements associated with traded products, also commonly referred to as land footprints. These accounts face challenges in two main areas: (1) the allocation of land to products traded and consumed and (2) the metrics to account for differences in land quality and land-use intensity. For two main families of accounting approaches (biophysical, factor-based and environmentally extended inputoutput analysis), this review discusses conceptual differences and compares results for land footprints. Biophysical approaches are able to capture a large number of products and different land uses, but suffer from a truncation problem. Economic approaches solve the truncation problem, but are hampered by the limited disaggregation of sectors and products. In light of the conceptual differences, the overall similarity of results generated by both types of approaches is remarkable. Diametrically opposed results for some of the world's largest producers and consumers of biomass-based products, however, make interpretation difficult. This review aims to provide clarity on some of the underlying conceptual issues of accounting for land footprints. © 2014 by Yale University.},

	abstract = {Sewage management of Happy Farmer's Home (HFH) in remote rural and mountain areas constituted a challenge because of the lack of adequate infrastructure and economic capability. The biogas system (BS) was a simple wastewater treatment way and could promise reusable fuel, but lots of them had low adoptive rate and obsolescence with unsuitable management, so they also would become a pollution source when tourist peak emerged and brought about huge amounts wastewater. This paper designed a multiplexed system (BSCB), component of septic tank (ST), constructed wetland (CW) and bio-pond (BP), to share responsibility of wastewater treatment from the biogas system and surroundings and was recognized as a robust and economical ecotechnology capable of meeting these challenges. This study examined and evaluated, by means of the emergy analysis, the use of environmental resources for wastewater treatment in HFH. The purpose of the analysis was to determine whether or not the installation of the BSCB system on HFH wastewater treatment might result in monetary savings and benefit the environment. The analysis done here showed that the proposed design not only resulted in sharing the load of wastewater treatment in HFH, but also reduced pressure on the local environment by providing the option of recycling clean water. Furthermore, the emergy analysis which used inputs both from natural ecosystems and the human economy, allowed a quantitative evaluation of the environmental savings due to water reused as well as the environmental impact due to the wastewater treatment process. It was demonstrated that BSCW system planted with a polyculture of ornamental plant species, besides the water treatment function, possessed several additional benefits including aesthetics and biodiversity enhancement. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Emerging new impacts that are characteristic of the anthropocene require more attention in current life cycle assessment (LCA), a framework in which many relevant impact assessment models are still missing. More attention, more data and more concern require the LCA community to intervene and to start or increase the modelling efforts to accommodate new impacts in LCA. To date the process of inclusion of new impacts in LCA has not yet been formalised. To deal with this process, a framework is here proposed and tested through the analysis of three emerging impact categories, noise, ecological light pollution (ELP) and radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF). We show that any development must start from a careful study of the theories and investigations from other specialist fields of science than the field of LCA. The gathering of such information is fundamental to assess the maturity of the impacts, their importance and the quality of the evidence that is available. In addition, this information has to be bridged to the computational structure of LCA, to check whether the physical properties of new impacts may be adjusted to the basics of LCA. We discuss the three new potential impact categories as a paradigm for action for any new development in LCA. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Beyond energy efficiency, there are now urgent challenges around the supply of resources, materials, energy, food and water. After debating energy efficiency for the last decade, the focus has shifted to include further resources and material efficiency. In this context, urban farming has emerged as a valid urban design strategy, where food is produced and consumed locally within city boundaries, turning disused sites and underutilized public space into productive urban landscapes and community gardens. Furthermore, such agricultural activities allow for effective composting of organic waste, returning nutrients to the soil and improving biodiversity in the urban environment. Urban farming and resource recovery will help to feed the 9 billion by 2050 (predicted population growth, UN-Habitat forecast 2009). This paper reports on best practice of urban design principles in regard to materials flow, material recovery, adaptive re-use of entire building elements and components (=design for disassembly'; prefabrication of modular building components), and other relevant strategies to implement zero waste by avoiding waste creation, reducing wasteful consumption and changing behaviour in the design and construction sectors. The paper touches on two important issues in regard to the rapid depletion of the world's natural resources: the built environment and the education of architects and designers (both topics of further research). The construction and demolition (C&D) sector: Prefabricated multi-story buildings for inner-city living can set new benchmarks for minimizing construction wastage and for modular on-site assembly. Today, the C&D sector is one of the main producers of waste; it does not engage enough with waste minimization, waste avoidance and recycling. Education and research: It's still unclear how best to introduce a holistic understanding of these challenges and to betterteach practical and affordable solutions to architects, urban designers, industrial designers, and so on. How must urban development and construction change and evolve to automatically embed sustainability in the way we design, build, operate, maintain and renew/recycle cities? One of the findings of this paper is that embedding zero-waste requires strong industry leadership, new policies and effective education curricula, as well as raising awareness (through research and education) and refocusing research agendas to bring about attitudinal change and the reduction of wasteful consumption. © 2011 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the life cycle of rainbow trout under three culturing systems including flow-through, recirculating and semi-closed recirculating systems in Iran. The life cycle assessment (LCA) method was found to be suited very well for this purpose. LCA method was used to quantify and compare the potential environmental impacts of culturing rainbow trout in the above three aquaculture systems. Differences were found between the above three systems in terms of water dependence, land competition, feed production processes and energy use. Feed production was found to be the major contributor to the potential impacts such as climate change and acidification in all of the above three systems due to variable feed conversion ratios (FCR, 1.15, 1.47 and 1.57) in flow-through, recirculating and semi-closed recirculating systems, respectively. The results indicated that the semi-closed recirculating system was less efficient than the flow-through system, with a higher level of potential eutrophication (49% greater), abiotic depletion (80% greater) and global warming (82% greater). The recirculating system required about 10 time more material and energy demands compared to the flow-through system. Water dependence in the flow-through system was calculated to be 27 and 3.7 times more than for the recirculating and semi-closed recirculating systems, respectively for the same quantity of biomass production. The major contribution to the land use was feed ingredient production (up to 95%) for the semi-closed recirculating and recirculating system. On the other hand, the land use in the flow-through system on farm rainbow trout production and feed ingredient production were calculated about 11 and 89%, respectively. Therefore, many options exist for improving the environmental performance of these aquaculture systems. The most important measure is to increase the feed and energy efficiency through improvements in rearing modes and the optimisation of feeding practices. It is recommended that excluded impacts such as biodiversity and socio-economic impacts be carefully considered in further sustainability assessments of recirculating and semi-closed recirculating systems and in continuing efforts to improve and develop these technologies on a larger scale. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {There is broad consensus that tackling the increasing global environmental problems will require the support of technology. Consequently, environmental technologies are regarded as one of the fastest growing global markets. Owing to the wide range of technologies available that can contribute to progress in this field, there is a high demand for prospective research setting priorities in a transparent way. Against this background, the presented study aimed at supporting the process of identifying and recommending options for the prioritisation of future research funding. Taking Germany as an example, this was done by analysing chances and perspectives of different environmental technologies as well as courses of action in combination with the aim of reaching new markets for seven environmental fields of action: Climate protection, air pollution control, water management, soil conservation, protection of scarce resources, waste management and biodiversity. As a key-element of the study, future environmental challenges and promising future technological developments were identified by an extensive literature review and internet research, followed by a large-scale expert survey and several topic-specific workshops. Results demonstrate that one focus of future funding should be put on technology development for meeting the demands of emerging and developing countries. Thus, an appropriate response for the German environmental industry to such global challenges requires the provision of exportable environmental technologies, although this will change the requirement profiles of the technologies. Many high-tech-products, developed for the European market, are not directly applicable or invaluable for emerging and developing countries. The study also recommends that funding should not concentrate on individual technologies, but rather on holistic views of technologies, processes, material and energy flows. Furthermore, the estimations of market potential for the investigated technologies are closely connected to the ecological problems and their social perception in different countries. Basis strategies should be developed, which take into account the technical development as well as the main drivers and constrains. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, the need to develop tree saplings well before they can be deployed on reforestation sites can delay the start of the sequestration process. This study proposed a way to reduce this time wastage by creating and erecting a special hydroponic greenhouse system on the reforestation site, while waiting for the saplings to be ready. While in service, this system makes use of an "active" mode of removing carbon dioxide from distributed and stationary sources, such as onsite generators that are widely used around the world and yet relatively neglected in the carbon capture and sequestration literature. Experimental tests and theoretical modeling of a hypothetical scaled-up version of the hydroponic greenhouse system using Ipomoea aquatica Forsk as the "stand-in" plant sequesters showed that this greenhouse system can potentially remove an amount of carbon dioxide equal to what fully grown water oak trees occupying the same land area can remove, but in a much shortr time. That is, this greenhouse system can kick-start and augment the sequestration function of the reforestation program. The methodology described in this study can be applied to determine appropriate "stand-in" plants for any kind of tree species that are selected for a reforestation program. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Neutralization aims to manage stakeholder impressions on very socially sensitive issues. Based on the content analysis of 148 sustainability reports from mining organizations, the study sheds light on the successful use of rhetoric in reports on non-measurable and potentially unaccountable issues. Specifically, the study shows that mining organizations use four main techniques of neutralization when they explain their impact on biodiversity. When they address stakeholders, they defend their social legitimacy and environmental responsiveness using one of the four techniques: they claim of a net positive or neutral impact on biodiversity, they deny that they have a significant impact, they distance themselves from the impact of their actions, and they play down their responsibilities. The study contributes to the literature on corporate sustainability and accounting for stakeholders. It focuses on under-researched issues such as the management of biodiversity and the tactics used to rationalize negative impacts. The study also bridges the gap between theories about organizational legitimacy, impression management, and techniques of neutralization. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {Namibia is the driest country in sub-Saharan Africa, but well known for its richness in species and sustainable natural resource utilization. The Namibian farming sector consists mainly of extensive farming systems. Cattle production contributes 54% of the livestock sector's production output, followed by sheep and goats (25%), hides and skins (9%), and other forms of agricultural production (12%). Namibia's freehold farmers have obtained ownership rights over land and livestock since the early 1900s; commercial rights over wildlife and plants were given to freehold farmers in 1967 and to communal farmers in 1996. Natural resource-based production systems then overtook agricultural production systems and exceeded it by a factor of at least two. The shift from practicing conservation to sustainable utilization of natural resources contributed to the rapid growth of wildlife utilization. The wildlife industry in Namibia is currently the only animal production system that is expanding. There are in total at least two million head of different wildlife species. The broader impact of the utilization of wildlife on the economy is estimated to be around N$ 1.3 billion. Tourism, live sales and trophy hunting, cannot sustain further growth. Wildlife farming could offer better opportunities for ensuring long-term sustainability. As the game meat trade in Namibia is not formalized, harvesting wildlife to satisfy the demand for game meat in export markets is still in its infancy. Sustainable harvesting of wildlife for meat production, however, has the potential to increase earnings to the beneficiaries in the wildlife sector. © 2010 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Through the use of institutional theory and the resource-based view of the firm, we shed some light on why, more than 20 years after sustainable development was first introduced, we see neither the adoption of this business model as dominant nor its converse, that is the total abandonment of the model as unworkable and unprofitable. We focus on multinational corporations (MNCs) because they were among the organizations first called to take action. In order to illustrate the institutional pressures MNCs face and their strategic response to these pressures, we analysed four major oil and gas multinationals subject to similar sustainable development pressures - climate change, biodiversity, renewable energy development and social investment. We argue that normative and coercive isomorphism does not occur at the global level because sustainable development is largely a stakeholder-driven rather than a broad social pressure. That is, host country interpretation of sustainable development pressures varies across an MNC's subsidiary network. Based on the analysis of the four major MNCs' annual reports from 2000 to 2005, we argue that mimetic isomorphism may occur, but since it implies the use of complex and intangible resources, mimetic processes are slow, rare and discretionary. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {The increased use of freshwater for domestic, industrial and agricultural activities has rapidly led to the scarcity of global water supplies with agricultural industry being the main consumer of fresh water, accounting to approximately 85% of the global freshwater consumption. Palm oil is the biggest and fastest growing vegetable oil on the world market and oil palm plantations are covering large land areas especially in Indonesia and Malaysia. Several environmental problems related to oil palm plantation have been reported, such as biodiversity loss, land use change, huge water consumption and river pollution. Water footprint analysis has been used to indicate the water consumption of a country, product, services or even an individual. However, methods to assess water usage in crude palm oil plantations is not available to date. Thus, this paper aims to provide a method in calculating water footprint for crude palm oil productions in Malaysia. The most appropriate method was identified based on an extensive literature survey. ISO 14046 was chosen as a guideline because it is an international standard in reporting and assessing water footprint (WF) with LCA approach. This study preferred the use of the comprehensive water footprint assessment compared to the stand-alone assessment because this approach can assess all the potential environmental impact related to water which are associated with a product, process or organization. It is expected that the water degradation level in this plantation can be identified to provide guidelines to the government, plantation companies as well as developers for the development of sustainable palm oil plantation in Malaysia. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

The goal of this study was to quantify the main sources of terrestrial ecosystem damage from pasta production, based on a regionalised life cycle inventory and impact assessment. The impacts on terrestrial biodiversity caused by climate change, ecotoxicity, acidification, land use, photochemical ozone formation and water use were assessed for pasta production from durum wheat on 90 farms in Iran. The results showed that the agricultural stage was the main source of environmental damage in the life cycle of pasta production. Most variability between farms is caused by variation in the wheat yields. Climate change contribution, water use (for irrigation), and photochemical ozone formation were the main contributors to the impacts on terrestrial biodiversity. Climate change contribution was mainly due to carbon dioxide emissions from diesel fuel burning during agricultural operations. Nitrogen oxide emissions from nitrogen fertiliser production were the main contributor to photochemical ozone formation. Farmers can reduce their diesel use in field operations by combining tillage operations so that only one pass across the soil is required. Various innovative practices in irrigation, such as sprinkler irrigation, can result in higher yields which will lead to reduced environmental damage relating to water use. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Originally concrete drainage channels in existing residential catchments, a series of wetlands and ponds were created i.e. green infrastructure in a brownfield setting. Boardwalks, pathways and interpretive signage were incorporated into the design. Golden Pond wetland was only 0.2% of the catchment whereas Bridgewater Creek – Bowie's Flat wetland was 0.4% of the catchment. The larger 0.8 ha Bridgewater Creek wetland had an overflow by-pass channel. Water quality (suspended solids and nutrients) and the diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrates were monitored for 2–4 years after construction. During storm events suspended solids increased at Golden Pond due to resuspension from the high velocities in this small linear flow system. Resuspension was minimised at Bridgewater Creek due to the by-pass channel. During dry weather suspended solids in both wetlands increased due to resuspension from the activity of waterbirds. Both wetlands were effective in reducing nutrient concentrations especially NOx–N and PO4–P, attributed to biological uptake; but during dry periods NH4–N increased within the system. The concept of irreducible background concentrations in wetland systems is discussed. Open water and aquatic vegetation provided habitats for macroinvertebrates. Species richness increased by more than 50% in both stormwater wetlands, compared to the concrete drains. Wetland sizing and design are essential parameters for water quality improvement and biodiversity. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Terrestrial ecoregions of the world have been extensively converted to croplands as a result of human demand for food, fibers, fuels and fodder. Agricultural land cover change has been listed as one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss and change in ecosystem biogeochemical budgets. To provide a quantitative estimate of human impacts on ecosystems, we estimate the amount of net primary production appropriated by the world's croplands from potential natural vegetation cover. Potential net primary production embodied in the 170 crops analyzed was determined using a combination of existing spatial data on crop production and yield statistics, distribution of terrestrial ecoregions and net primary production of potential vegetation. We found that global croplands directly appropriate 9.1 Gt of carbon annually, which is about 14% of potential net primary production. The intensity of human impacts on terrestrial ecoregions differs according to the level of anthropogenic conversion to croplands. Temperate grasslands and savannas have been traditionally converted into croplands and therefore productivity appropriation reaches the highest levels of 34% in aggregate. In addition to the analysis of appropriation of net primary productivity in terrestrial regions, we also report intensity factors describing the embodied amount of productivity lost by conversion of natural regions into croplands. The results of appropriation of original natural net primary production by croplands contribute to discussion of the differences in land use intensity in different countries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {A commonly agreed methodology for weighting the relative importance of different environmental impacts in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is lacking, although it is becoming a typical phase in LCA. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) provides an avenue to develop weighting tools applicable in LCA. The purpose of this paper is to describe a process of assessing environmental impacts of two alternative raw materials and to present the problems related to it. A panel which includes experts in measuring the environmental impacts of biomass production was requested to identify and weight impact categories to assess environmental impacts of biomass production. The panelists identified new environmental impacts (such as biodiversity) not included to the standard LCA. The highest weights were given by the panelists to climate change, natural land use change and biodiversity. The environmental impacts were analyzed for four case biomass production chains producing biodiesel and pulp in Finland. In case chains, the raw material for biodiesel is Asian palm oil or Finnish rapeseed oil, while the raw material for pulp is South American eucalyptus or Finnish birch. The calculations of the LCA impacts were limited to the impact categories for which inventory data were available. In calculations, different types of normalization procedures were tested to receive information on their effects on the LCA results. According to the results, in some cases normalization have considerable impact on the magnitude of the results. In general, the results imply that biomass imported from developing countries has less environmental impacts compared to the local forest and field biomass produced in Finland. However, due to the several sources of uncertainties included in the results, they are only to be used for illustrative purposes. In the future, applying the MCDA in LCA may deepen the applicability of the analyses, if valid and reliable data is available. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Local actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change are essential for stabilization of the global climate and can also help to address other urban ecological problems such as pollution, decreasing biodiversity, etc. Companies are important urban actors in the development of low-carbon cities because they provide a multitude of goods and services to city populations and directly influence urban carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. This is a new area of research. While studies on corporate sustainability are numerous, there is little, if any, existing research that examines the role of companies in climate change adaptation and mitigation within specific urban areas. Urban ecologists also have not examined how corporate activity affects urban systems. Taking a multi-disciplinary systems approach, we present a conceptual model of the role of companies in managing urban interactions with the climate system. We also present empirical findings illustrating how one company 'partners' with the city of Rotterdam to test electric vehicles as a pilot project for urban climate adaptation and mitigation. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. and ERP Environment.},

	abstract = {Broadly conceived and considered in its many usages, sustainability has grave defects as a planning goal, particularly when used by conservationists: it confuses means and ends; it is vague about what is being sustained and who or what is doing the sustaining; it is uninspiring; it is little more than Pinchot-era conservation (and thus ignores the many lessons learned since then); it need not be linked to land, to the lands functioning, or to any ecological science; it need not include a moral component; it is consistent with the view of humans as all-powerful manipulators of the planet; and, in general, it is such a malleable term that its popularity provides only a facade of consensus. When sustainability is defined broadly to include the full range of economic and social aspirations, it poses the particular risk that ecological and biodiversity concerns will be cast aside in favor of more pressing human wants. Given these many defects, the conservation movement should discard the term in favor of a more alluring goal, attentive to nature and its ecological functioning. A sound goal would incorporate and distill the considerable ecological and moral wisdom accumulated since Pinchots day while giving conservationists the rhetorical tools needed to defend the land against competing pressures. In our view, conservation would be well served by an updated variant of land health, Aldo Leopolds ecologically grounded goal from the 1940s. Land health as an independent understanding should set the essential terms of how we live and enjoy the earth, providing the framework within which we pursue our many social and economic aims. © Tom Campbell and David Mollica 2009.

	abstract = {The fear that human consumption is causing climate change, biodiversity loss, and mineral scarcity has recently prompted interest in reuse because of the intuitive belief that it reduces new production and waste. The environmental impacts of reuse have, however, received little attention—the benefits typically assumed rather than understood—and consequently the overall effects remain unclear. In this article, we structure the current work on the topic, reviewing the potential benefits and pitfalls described in the literature and providing a framework for future research. Many products’ use-phase energy requirements are decreasing. The relative importance of the embodied impacts from initial production is therefore growing and the prominence of reuse as an abatement strategy is likely to increase in the future. Many examples are found in the literature of beneficial reuse of standardized, unpowered products and components, and repairing an item is always found to be less energy intensive than new production. However, reusing a product does not guarantee an environmental benefit. Attention must be paid to restoring and upgrading old product efficiencies, minimizing overspecification in the new application, and considering whether more efficient, new products exist that would be more suitable. Cheap, reused goods can allow many consumers access to products they would otherwise have been unable to afford. Though socially valuable, these sales, which may help minimize landfill in the short term, can represent additional consumption rather than a net environmental benefit compared to the status quo. © 2015 by Yale University},

	abstract = {Complying with international agreements regarding environment, and particularly the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions, requires appropriate policies in the building sector. This study concerns single family housing in Chile. The aim of this work is to develop knowledge in order to define and prepare implementation of design procedures to minimize the environmental impacts without reducing the level of comfort in such buildings. The model presented is based upon the life cycle assessment methodology. Buildings are described including geometry and technological elements. Thermal simulation is used in a first step to evaluate heating and cooling loads, and to check the level of indoor comfort in summer. The results constitute an input to a life cycle simulation tool, integrating the fabrication of materials, construction, use of the building, maintenance and end of life. Environmental indicators like the global warming potential are evaluated. Other indicators concern air pollution, natural resource consumption, waste production etc. This model has been adapted to the Chilean context, particularly regarding the electricity production mix and climatic conditions, considering four climate zones characteristic of the country. In each zone, a typical social housing unit is defined and the corresponding environmental impacts are evaluated. Various technical and architectural solutions are studied, particularly: increased insulation thickness (applying thermal regulation), orientation of windows and glazing types. The performance improvement is higher in cold climates. A reduction of CO2 emissions up to 50% is estimated, and other technical measures are suggested to improve the performance further. According to these results, reducing energy related impacts does not increase other damage indicators related to e.g. human health and biodiversity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Soils are one of earth's essential natural resources, supporting nearly all terrestrial life. By and large, current life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methodologies are limited in their assessment of potential land use impacts in terms of terrestrial biodiversity loss. The land use life cycle impact assessment (LULCIA) project spearheaded by the United Nations Environment Programme/Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (UNEP/SETAC) Life Cycle Initiative recently broadened the scope of land use evaluation in life cycle assessment (LCA) by encompassing six additional indicators that represent ecosystem provision and regulation services, as defined in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005). Although LCIA methodology is more comprehensive with regards to relevant impact pathways linked to land use, the development could potentially decrease the capacity of LCA as a decision support system by increasing the number of indicators from one to seven for the assessment of the land use impact category alone. To overcome this limitation, the project proposes a new LCIA method to estimate the decrease in value of the ecosystem services provided to society due to land use. The six midpoint land use indicators proposed by the LULCIA project are further modeled into a new area of protection, resources and ecosystem services, based on a functional approach. To do so, indicators expressed in biophysical units are converted into monetary units based on the economic valuation of the reduction of a given ecosystem service. The loss of provision services biotic production and fresh water recharge are estimated through productivity loss and water supply cost, respectively. The regulation services erosion resistance and mechanical and physicochemical water filtration are estimated through the cost of erosion mitigation measures and water purification process costs, respectively. The climate regulation potential is estimated through the social carbon cost: a decrease in carbon sequestration by soils is considered equivalent to an amount of carbon emitted in the atmosphere. We also propose to consider the local socioeconomic context by evaluating the economic adaptation capacity of countries: impacts on the resources and ecosystem services area of protection are only accounted for when the country has the capacity to adapt (while indirect impacts would be calculated by assessing the burdens of the adaptation scenario by performing a full LCA of these adaptation measures). The application of the method is illustrated through a case study evaluating the cradle-to-gate land use impacts of three bio-based polymers (biopolyethylene, polylactic acid and thermoplastic starch) produced in Brazil, Italy, Thailand and the United States. Impact scores are not only influenced by the biophysical specificity of the studied systems (e.g. crop yield affecting the inventory flow, type of biome affecting impact characterisation) but also by the local socioeconomic capacity to compensate for an ecosystem service loss and available compensation measures and technologies. In this case study, thermoplastic starch appears to have fewer impacts on land use and ecosystem services than biopolyethylene or polylactic acid. Overall, the research demonstrates the feasibility of further modeling the biophysical indicators of land use into an economic metric. This additional and complementary modeling step is meant to facilitate the interpretation of LCA results, enabling discussions on the relevance of the biophysical indicators affecting the loss of ecosystem services from land use. It may also be used as an explicit weighting scheme to aggregate the midpoint results into a single value expressing the social cost to compensate for the loss of the ecosystem services. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Since 2000, soybean production has gained increasing importance in Brazil, particularly in Southern Amazonia and the state of Mato Grosso, the largest producer in the country. This expansion has taken place through cropland extensification into natural ecosystems in the Amazon (tropical forest) and Cerrado (savanna) biomes with land transformation and occupation activity well documented by remote sensing. Guidelines from the UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative now allow for impact assessment of land transformation and occupation within a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to estimate potential impacts to biodiversity and ecosystem services. In this study, we apply these guidelines to soybean produced in 2010 in order to complement more traditional soybean LCAs with mid- and end-point impact assessment on biodiversity, erosion potential, water purification, groundwater recharge, biotic production and climate regulation potential in each of the Amazon and Cerrado biomes. In addition to providing regionalized characterization factors of land transformation and occupation in both Mato Grosso biomes, we estimate that one tonne of soybean produced in 2010 in the Amazon had greater impacts than when produced in the Cerrado. For the Amazon, total land transformation and occupation damage was estimated at 532 ton−1and 260 ton−1respectively, with estimates of 231 ton−1and 153 ton−1for the Cerrado. The largest contributors to these damage estimates came from the change in mechanical filtration properties of the soil followed by the land's climate regulation and biotic production potentials. The impact allocation to pasture as a transitional landscape in the establishment of cropland onto natural ecosystems diminished the soybean contribution through allocation of pasture to the beef production system, further adding to the land sparing argument for future cropland expansion in the region. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the past decade, palm oil has risen to become the most produced and consumed vegetable oil in the world. Growth of commercial plantations in Southeast Asia and recent expansions in West Africa and Latin America have led to a growing call for the sustainable production of palm oil, driven to a large extent by concerns over the associated impacts of deforestation and biodiversity losses. This study investigates the academic response to the calls for the sustainable production of palm oil by identifying and analysing Thomson Reuters Institute for Scientific Information indexed palm oil sustainability related publications from 2004 to 2013. The results show that the total number of publications has increased exponentially from 11 in 2004 to 713 by 2013. However, this growth is shown to be carried mainly by research within technical aspects of palm oil residue use; publications in the categories of land use & land use change, biodiversity and socio-economic aspects have increased, but the growth has been markedly slower. It is thus argued that there is currently an imbalance in research strategies since the focus towards technical topics is at odds with the major sustainability issues raised about palm oil production. To address the current imbalance in palm oil research, this study proposes a holistic framework for palm oil sustainability research with the aim of achieving multidisciplinary studies and emphasizing collaboration between industry and academia. Research sponsors and public bodies in charge of science, social science and technology research frameworks will thus benefit from improved understanding of where research and development resources can be allocated to facilitate the transition towards improved sustainability. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Economic sectors contribute to biodiversity loss via environmental pressures, such as land use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, directly and via their supply chains. This study is the first that systematically quantifies supply-chain-related environmental pressures and terrestrial biodiversity losses in relation to sectoral production by presenting so-called biodiversity footprints for 47 sectors in the Dutch economy. The supply chains of the food and chemical sectors were investigated in more detail, by applying a structural path analysis. Mean Species Abundance (MSA) was used as a biodiversity indicator, representing the degree of ecosystem naturalness. Our results revealed that (i) the largest supply-chain-related biodiversity losses occur in land-intensive and energy-intensive sectors; (ii) sectors that produce primary resources, such as crops and livestock, showed the largest biodiversity footprint per EUR of output; (iii) for most sectors in the Dutch economy, more than 50% of the biodiversity losses related to their supply chains were being caused abroad; and (iv) more than 45% of the supply-chain-related losses caused by the food and chemical sectors occurred upstream of the direct suppliers. Our results imply that mitigation of GHG emissions as well as land-use-related options should be considered in sectoral strategies to protect global biodiversity. The results create a clear rational for not only improving sectoral production efficiency, but also for taking supply-chain responsibility. Supply-chain-related biodiversity losses often cannot be directly influenced by the sector, or occur in other countries. Additional strategies may be needed then to reduce global biodiversity losses. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {There is widespread concern that the 'economy is crashing against the Earth', already causing problems in terms of climate change, water depletion and loss of biodiversity. Yet, the global economy still will have to grow two- to four-fold to provide all future global inhabitants with the average yearly income of $10,000 that is needed to have a reasonable life expectancy and human development index. Rio+20 was intended to reconcile the need for poverty eradication with a green economy, but had limited perceived success. This paper analyses how some of the major international sustainability programs that contributed to Rio+20 could have supported a more far-reaching outcome. Two problems are identified: the programs showed significant overlap, and the programs themselves were often incremental in nature, seeking compromises and avoiding more radical approaches such as the 'degrowth agenda'. To address the first problem, we suggest how a natural process of mutual collaboration, learning and strengthening could occur: the UN Green Economy Initiative could focus on providing the socio-economic rationale for sustainability; bodies like the IPCC and the UNEP Resources Panel could focus on providing the environmental rationale and planetary limits related to sustainability; programs in the field of sustainable consumption and production as well as resource-efficient and cleaner production could focus on providing hands-on support and proof of how to change direction. There seems no clear-cut answer for the second problem. Some authors suggest relying more on action outside formal policy systems that, by nature, seek compromises. However, they also see a required role for government action, which is exactly what Rio+20 and its supportive policy programs failed to achieve and negotiate. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The human health and environmental issues related to food, feed, and bio-based systems, range widely from greenhouse gas emissions and energy use to land use, water availability, soil quality, water quality and quantity, biodiversity losses, and chemical exposure. Threats that stem from other issues, including food quality and food security, the development of genetically modified organisms, desertification, pesticide exposure, antibiotic-resistant strains of microorganisms, growth hormone residues in food, etc.; are of concern. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology provides the organizing framework to holistically evaluate the environmental impacts of products and production systems, whether it's to make a durable, disposable or edible good. The use of LCA in environmental management and sustainability has grown rapidly in recent years as demonstrated by the increasing number of published papers on LCA methodology and case studies, which totaled over 4,500 by 2010. Recognizing the need to focus on the impacts of the agri-food industry, this special issue was developed by selecting sixteen papers from the 85 presented at the Bari LCA Food 2010 conference, and publishing them with eight papers submitted as part of the normal flow to the Journal of Cleaner Production on food-related subjects. The papers in this special issue include case studies from LCAs on relevant dimensions of production of a wide array of types of food, discussions on methodological issues, especially water and land use, the application of product certification schemes, and food preservation. The editors of this special issue acknowledge that progress has been made in strengthening the LCA tools but challenge all LCA practitioners and researchers to push the envelope on LCA methodology and encourage them to develop tools that dynamically address the diverse, rapidly evolving issues related to agricultural products that are not currently addressed. It is hoped the challenges that are outlined in this Special Issue will stimulate many to make progress on improving the food LCA tools prior to the next food LCA conference in this series, which will be held in Saint-Malo, France, on 2-4 October 2012.

Many advances in water quality have led to unquestionable improvements in ecosystem quality, habitat and biodiversity, and water infrastructure. Still, Great Lakes scientists have issued compelling evidence that the ecological health of the basin ecosystem is at significant risk. In 2012, the Agreement will be revised for the first time in 25 years. The degree of engagement in a future Agreement, including scope, issues of significant importance, governance and collaboration will hinge on a thorough analytical process, so far seemingly absent, coupled with real consultation, so far marginally evident. Renegotiating the Agreement to generate a revitalized and sustainable future mandates that science inform contemporary public policy, and that inclusive discourse and public engagement be integral through the process. Many of these steps are still absent, and the analysis presented here strongly suggests that the constituents of the Great Lakes regime voice their views critically, emphatically, and often. If the negotiators listen, we can collectively make the Lakes Great. © 2012 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Integrating biodiversity conservation into forest management requires changes in the practices of those public and private actors that have implementing responsibilities and whose strategic and operational opportunities are at stake. Understanding this kind of context-dependent institutional adaptation entails bridging between two analytical approaches: policy implementation and organizational adaptation. This article combines these two approaches by reviewing them, and their caveats, and by summarizing empirical analyses of organizational competences, specialization, professional judgment, and organizational networks in the organizational field of non-industrial private forestry in Finland. Drawing on these theoretical and empirical analyses, the article discloses the broad phenomenon of institutional adaptation in the integration of biodiversity conservation and forest management. The empirical analyses point to the dominance of hierarchical policy implementation over strategic organizational adaptation. Together with the detected isomorphism of professional norms and networks, these contribute to meeting minimum standards but can constrain the ways in which the organizations and professionals respond to the challenge of biodiversity conservation. The detected inertia signals lack of alertness. It is perhaps also an indication of self-sufficiency among the actors. The interpretation of these responses to challenges and responsibilities across the public and private sector boundaries demonstrates the necessity of combining the two traditionally segregated approaches. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The biodiversity footprints were quantified using mean species abundance statistics, whereas the ecological footprint refers to the impacts on bioproductivity. We used a data set of 1340 product systems subdivided into 13 product groups, which included various types of energy generation and material production. We found that the importance of direct land use vs. carbon dioxide emissions is different for biodiversity footprints compared to ecological footprints. This difference is particularly relevant if the environmental impact of bio-based products (dominated by direct land use) is compared with the environmental impact of fossil-based products (dominated by CO 2 emissions). Our results also show that the relative importance of different drivers can change over time within the biodiversity footprint and that the relative importance of climate change significantly increased for longer time horizons. As the interpretation of the biodiversity footprint can differ from the ecological footprint, the inclusion of impacts on biodiversity should be considered in the footprint calculation of products. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Climate change impacts are a key challenge for sustainable urban development. To address this challenge, ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA), i.e., the use of ecosystem services and biodiversity to help people adapt to climate change, is increasingly being considered as an alternative or complement to traditional, engineering-based approaches (increasingly also known as nature-based solutions). However, little research on ecosystem-based adaptation has been carried out in urban areas, and empirical evidence of its effectiveness and uptake in strategic adaptation planning is particularly lacking. Against this background, this study investigates the implementation of urban EbA in strategic adaptation planning. Based on a comparative analysis of all German municipalities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, it examines the integration of EbA into municipal adaptation strategies. The results show that there is, so far, no comprehensive uptake of the EbA concept. While current strategies differ significantly in their type, structure, scope, maturity and content, overall the EbA concept remains implicit. 76% of the assessed strategies include some kind of ecosystem-based adaptation measures, which focus on enhancing the conservation, restoration, creation or sustainable management of ecosystems, and 25% of all strategies highlight the multiple benefits of these measures. However, comprehensive approaches are missing. We conclude that better policy support and comprehensive mainstreaming of EbA (e.g., through more distributed urban governance, science-policy integration, combined top-down policies and bottom-up activities) is urgently needed to foster sustainable urban development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Normalization and weighting steps used in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) are often ignored as the weighting factors currently available are seen as being uncertain, subjective and unreliable. This article aims to contribute to the development of a new approach towards weighting, exploring the application of the concept of a planetary safe operating space for human welfare. Based on this approach, the boundaries included in this study relate to: climate change, rate of biodiversity loss, nitrogen cycle, phosphorus cycle, stratospheric ozone depletion, global freshwater use and change in land use. The weighting factors are then applied to a case study comparing environmental impacts of organic, conventional and integrated farming systems with alternative land uses. An integrated farming system that uses a part of the land for natural forest was found to have the lowest total impact score. Conventional farming systems with Miscanthus and managed forest had the highest total impact scores. The main source of uncertainty in the results arose from the wide range of assessments for the safe boundary of the biodiversity loss impact category. As the weighting factors proposed in this paper are not based on the common LCA impact categories, more work is needed to adjust the weighting factors to be suitable for use in LCA studies. More research is also needed for further defining the safe planetary boundaries. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The European Union (EU) relies largely on bioenergy to achieve its climate and energy targets for 2020 and beyond. Special focus is placed on utilization of biomass residues, which are considered to cause low environmental impacts. We used the dataset from the latest European Commission document on the sustainability of solid and gaseous biomass (SWD2014 259), complementing those results by: i) designing three pathways for domestic-heat production using forest logging residues, with different combustion technologies; ii) expanding the analysis to include forest carbon stock development with and without bioenergy; iii) using absolute climate metrics to assess the surface temperature response by the end of the century to a bioenergy and a reference fossil system; iv) including multiple climate forcers (well-mixed GHG, near term climate forcers and surface albedo change); iv) quantifying life cycle impacts on acidification, particulate matter emissions and photochemical ozone formation; v) reviewing potential risks for forest ecosystem degradation due to increased removal of residues. Supply-chain GHG savings of the three pathways analysed ranged between 80% and 96% compared to a natural gas system, above the 70% threshold suggested by the EU. However, the climate impact of bioenergy should be assessed by considering also the non-bioenergy uses of the biomass and by including all climate forcers. We calculate the Surface Temperature Response to bioenergy and fossil systems by means of Absolute Global surface Temperature Potential (AGTP) metric. Domestic heating from logging residues is generally beneficial to mitigate the surface temperature increase by 2100 compared to the use of natural gas and other fossil sources. As long as residues with a decay rate in the forest higher than 2.7%∗yr-1 are considered as feedstock, investing now in the mobilization of residues for heat production can reduce the temperature increase by 2100 compared to all the fossil sources analysed, both in case of bioenergy as a systemic change or in case of bioenergy as a transitory option. Furthermore, several environmental risks are associated with the removal and use of forest logging residues for bioenergy. These issues concern mostly local air pollution, biodiversity loss and, mainly for stumps removal, physical damage to forest soils. Forest logging residues are not free of environmental risks. Actions promoting their use should consider: (i) that climate change mitigation depends mainly on the decay rate of biomass under natural decomposition and time and rate of technology deployment, (ii) whether management guidelines aimed at protecting long-term forest productivity are in place and (iii) whether proper actions for the management of adverse effects on local air pollution are in place. © 2015 The Authors.},

The needs of LCA practitioners are crucial to determine what characteristics biodiversity assessment models should possess. Available models are mainly apt for impact hotspot detection in supply chains. If the goal is to assess the impacts of plot-level management practices they should be accompanied by other more detailed tools beyond LCA. Site-specific data are necessary to accurately assess biodiversity loss at regional and local scale, despite known constraints imposed by life cycle inventories. Examples of datasets are provided in this article. Species richness is a promising start for these models but it must be complemented with metrics for habitat configuration and intensitybased indicators.

	abstract = {Summary: This article assesses the sustainability benefits of replacing virgin sand and crushed limestone with Red Sand for road construction and top dressing. The sustainability of Red Sand was assessed using a triple bottom line analysis that includes economic, social, and environmental objectives. Each of these objectives consists of a number of headline performance indicators, with each being the aggregate of key performance indicators that measure whether Red Sand applications foster or impede sustainability. Red Sand is a newly developed product that is expected to be commercially available in 2014. It is produced by washing and carbonating the coarse fraction of the residue produced by the Bayer alumina refining process. Our assessment indicates that replacing virgin sand and crushed limestone with Red Sand will provide a range of financial and environmental benefits. For example, some environmental impacts associated with using virgin sand and crushed limestone, such as loss of biodiversity and land degradation, can be avoided by substituting Red Sand. Also, the use of Red Sand for road construction and top dressing is expected to conserve land and raw materials for future generations, thus enhancing intergenerational social equity. The energy consumption associated with producing Red Sand is projected to be lower than that required to quarry virgin sand and crushed limestone, thereby conserving energy and reducing the overall greenhouse impact of road construction and top-dressing applications that use virgin sand and crushed limestone. The greenhouse benefit of Red Sand is further enhanced by avoiding the loss of vegetation associated with sand and limestone quarrying. There are also intangible benefits expected from the substitution of Red Sand, including ecological, aesthetic, and recreational benefits associated with bushland conservation, a significant issue in areas surrounding metropolitan Perth. © 2013 by Yale University.},

	abstract = {Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a biological process which produces biomethane as energy source, using waste as substrate. Cometabolism is a novel way to enhance liquid AD, via augmenting the biodiversity of inoculums, especially in the hitherto little-studied 96-h initiation period critical to AD startup. Dog, horse and sheep feces were used as sources of inoculum and mixed with fruit and vegetable waste (FVW) and water. Thermophilic (55 °C), mesophilic (39°) and psychrophilic (25 °C) AD conditions were tested. As inoculum and water quantities alter the abundance and diversity of the anaerobic communities, 1:1 and 1:4 ratios of FVW feedstock to inoculum solutions were compared. Live Saccharomyces cerevisiae was supplemented as probiotic in the anaerobic reactors. Biogas, CO2 and CH4 were measured as well as digestion of FVW. Results showed consistently more CH4 production under cometabolism, higher inoculum density and thermophilic conditions; higher CH4, pH and digestion simultaneously occurred in the mixed-inoculum reactors. A strong relationship between biogas and its CO2 and CH4 main components was found. Horse inoculum in the mixed reactors enhanced CH4 production; sheep inoculums improved digestibility; and the dog inoculum seemed to neutralize pH. S. cerevisiae may have improved cellulolytic activity in FVW digestion at 25 and 39 °C, and provided an energy and nutrient source at 55 °C. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

We focus on the production stages of salmon farming-freshwater hatcheries used to produce smolts and marine grow-out sites using open netpens. Specifically, we propose two impact categories: impacts of nutrient release and impacts on biodiversity. Proposed indicators for impacts of nutrient release are (1) the area altered by farm waste, (2) changes in nutrient concentration in the water column, (3) the percent of carrying capacity reached, (4) the percent of total anthropogenic nutrient release, and (5) release of wastes into freshwater. Proposed indicators for impacts on biodiversity are (1) the number of escaped salmon, (2) the number of reported disease outbreaks, (3) parasite abundance on farms, and (4) the percent reduction in wild salmon survival. For each proposed indicator, an example of how the indicator could be estimated is given and the strengths and weaknesses of that indicator are discussed. We propose that including local environmental impacts as well as global-scale ones in LCA allows us to better identify potential trade-offs, where actions that are beneficial at one scale are harmful at another, and synchronicities, where actions have desirable or undesirable effects at both spatial scales. We also discuss the potential applicability of meta-analytic statistical techniques to LCA. © 2012 by Yale University.},

After one landfill is fully filled, the aftercare management turns into an important issue for municipalities, while the deposited waste is highly complex and condensed. Recent literature has indicated that landfill management plays an important role on critical issues of contemporary solid waste management, including biodiversity preservation, global warming mitigation, landfill mining and land reclamation. This study firstly made a comprehensive literature review on the existing studies in several Asia-Pacific economies, secondly conducted field surveys for the several illustrations of the aftercare management of closed landfills in Japan and Taiwan. Afterward, the findings from the literature and illustrations from the Asia-Pacific region were qualitatively summarized. Based on the results, concrete management strategies were discussed for the aftercare management of closed landfills in the context of land reclamation from important perspectives. For promoting the closed landfill management and seeking for adequate reclamation methods, the ex-post monitoring, impact assessments, and the essential cost-benefit analysis should be implemented with regard to respective reclamation type and local conditions. Using the outcomes of this study, municipalities can formulate concrete strategies to mitigate the risks and negative impacts, and to increase the benefits of landfills from a life-cycle perspective, considering the multi-stakeholders. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We argue that it can make a far greater contribution to increased productivity. In particular, a wider deployment of agricultural biodiversity is an essential component in the sustainable delivery of a more secure food supply. Diversity of kingdoms, species and genepools can increase the productivity of farming systems in a range of growing conditions, and more diverse farming systems are also generally more resilient in the face of perturbations, thus enhancing food security. Diversity can maintain and increase soil fertility and mitigate the impact of pests and diseases. Diversity of diet, founded on diverse farming systems, delivers better nutrition and greater health, with additional benefits for human productivity and livelihoods. Agricultural biodiversity will also be absolutely essential to cope with the predicted impacts of climate change, not simply as a source of traits but as the underpinnings of more resilient farm ecosystems. Many of the benefits of agricultural biodiversity are manifested at different ecological and human scales, and cut across political divisions, requiring a cross-sectoral approach to reassess the role of agricultural biodiversity in sustainable and secure food production. © 2011 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Soils provide essential ecosystem services for supporting both human and ecosystem needs and has been under pressures resulting from the intensification and expansion of human activities. In the last 15 years, substantial efforts have been made to quantify the impacts on soils derived from production systems and their related supply chains. In this study, a systematic, qualitative evaluation of up-to-date models connecting land occupation and land transformation to soil impact indicators (e.g., soil properties, functions, and threats) is performed. The focus is on models that may be applied for assessing supply chains, namely in the context of life cycle assessment (LCA). A range of eleven soil-related models was selected and evaluated against different criteria, including scientific soundness, stakeholders’ acceptance, reproducibility, and the applicability of models from the perspective of LCA practitioners. Additionally, this study proposes a new land use cause-effect chain to qualify the impacts of land use on soils. None of the models is fulfilling all the criteria and includes comprehensively the cause-effect impact pathways. Notably, trade-offs were most frequent between the relevance of the modeled impact processes and the models’ applicability. On the one hand, models proposing multi-indicators cover several drivers of impacts and have a broader scope. On the other hand, several models just focus on one driver of impact, but may provide more relevant impact characterization. Our results provide common ground for the development and identification of models that provide a comprehensive and robust assessment of land use change and land use impacts on soils. Indeed, to ensure both a comprehensive and relevant characterization of impacts, the study identifies several research needs for further models’ developments, namely: 1) adopting a common land use cause-effect chain and land use classification; 2) accounting for different land management and land use intensities; 3) expanding the inventory data beyond the accounting of the area related to a certain land use; 4) assessing the added value of multi-indicators compared to single indicators, including the reduction of possible redundancies in the impact evaluation; 5) improving consistency from midpoint to endpoint characterization, especially the link with biodiversity; 6) guiding the calculation of normalization factors; and 7) assessing systematically model's uncertainty. © 2016 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The growing need to use biofuel raw materials that do not compete with food and feed have resulted in a growing interest in lignocellulosic materials and microalgae. However, the life cycle environmental benefits of both biofuels have been questioned. The aim of this study was to evaluate how environmental sustainability of forest-based and microalgae biodiesel can be estimated by using the life cycle assessment framework. These biofuel chains were chosen because they are contrasting systems, as the first one is based on a "natural" feedstock production system, while the second one is an entirely anthropogenic system using an artificial infrastructure and external inputs to grow microalgae. This study focuses on life cycle impact categories still under methodological development, namely resource depletion, land use and land use change, water use, soil quality impacts and biodiversity. In addition, climate impacts were quantified in order to exemplify the uncertainty of the results and the complexity of estimating the parameters. This study demonstrates the difficulty to assess the absolute range of the total environmental impacts of the two systems. The results propose that the greenhouse gas emissions of microalgae biodiesel are higher than those of forest residue-based biodiesel, but the results of the microalgae chain are very uncertain due to the early development stage of the technology, and due to assumptions made concerning the electricity mix. On the other hand, the microalgae system has other advantages such as low competition on productive land and low biodiversity impacts. The findings help to recognise the main characteristics of the two production chains, and the main remaining research issues on bioenergy assessment along with the methodological development needs of life cycle approaches. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Environmental impacts from food consumption are dominated by the consumption of livestock products. Changes in consumption patterns are necessary to reduce these impacts. Information is a policy instrument that can influence consumers to make more sustainable choices, as well as increasing awareness of the problem and hence creating acceptance for financial policy instruments, e.g. taxes. Environmental studies of livestock often focus on greenhouse gas emissions. Although the carbon footprint of meat correlates with several other impact categories, there is a risk of conflicts with categories such as biodiversity loss, pesticide use and animal welfare. In an interdisciplinary project, a consumer guide was developed to assist Swedish consumers and food professionals at retail level in making less environmentally harmful meat choices and to act as a communication tool, raising awareness of the different environmental aspects of meat production and potential conflicts with animal welfare. A series of design requirements were established for the guide as regards communication and environmental assessment from a life cycle perspective. Following these, four indicators (carbon footprint, biodiversity, use of pesticides and animal welfare) were chosen to represent the impact on the environment and animal welfare from different choices of meat and other protein sources. For each indicator, criteria were developed that placed the products included in the meat guide in one of three different groups, represented by the well-known traffic light system of red/yellow/green. This first attempt to develop a meat guide for the Swedish market has several limitations, but should provide valuable guidance to consumers and can act as a basis for discussion in the important task of decreasing meat consumption and choosing better meat alternatives. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Being envisaged and implemented by Q'eqchi' Maya traditional healers of the southern Maya Mountains, Belize, this model can be replicated in other communities worldwide. A ethnobotany study in collaboration with these healers led to collection of 102 medicinal species from Itzama, their traditional healing cultural center and medicinal garden. Of these 102 species, 40 of prior reported 106 consensus study plants were present in the garden. There were 62 plants not previously reported growing in the garden as well. A general comparison of these plants was also made in relation to species reported in TRAMIL network, Caribbean Herbal Pharmacopoeia (CHP), the largest regional medicinal pharmacopoeia. A relative few species reported here were found in the CHP. However, the majority of the CHP plants are common in Belize and many are used by the nearby Mopan and Yucatec Maya. Since these 102 species are relied upon heavily in local primary healthcare, this Q'eqchi' Maya medicinal garden represents possibilities toward novel sustainable, culturally relative holistic health promotion and community based conservation practices. © 2010 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Human activities are threatening biodiversity at an unprecedented scale and pace, thus potentially affecting also the provision of critical ecosystem services, including insect pollination. Insect pollinators play an essential functional role in terrestrial ecosystems, supporting ecological stability and food security worldwide. Therefore, assessing impact on pollinators is fundamental in any effort aiming at enhancing the environmental sustainability of human production and consumption, especially in the agri-food supply chains. Different drivers are leading to pollinator populations’ declines. Improving a supply-chain oriented assessment of the occurrence of pressure and impacts on pollinators is needed. However, current methodologies assessing impact along supply chains, such as life cycle assessment (LCA), miss to assess impact on pollinators. In fact, none of the existing life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) models effectively accounts for pollinators. Some LCIA models have mentioned pollination, but none has presented key drivers of impact and a proposal for integrating pollinators as target group for biodiversity protection within an LCIA framework. In order to devise a pathway towards the inclusion of impacts on pollinators in LCIA, we conducted a literature review of environmental and anthropogenic pressures acting on insect pollinators, potentially threatening pollination services. Based on the evidence in literature, we identified and described eight potential impact drivers, primarily deriving from industrial development and intensive agricultural practice: 1) intensified land use as a result of uncontrolled expansion of urban areas and modern agricultural practices; 2) use of pesticides; 3) presence of invasive alien plants; 4) competition with invasive alien pollinator species; 5) global and local climate change; 6) spread of pests and pathogens; 7) electro-magnetic pollution and 8) genetically modified crops. To account for these drivers in LCIA, there are specific modeling needs. Hence, the current study provides recommendation on how future research should be oriented to improve the current models and how novel indicators should be developed in order to cover the existing conceptual and methodological gaps. © 2016 The Authors},

The final step of this study was the prioritization of the area that is best suited for ecotourism in assessing ecotourism sustainability in Surat Thani province. The result is useful for tourism facilities development and ecotourism resource utilization where ecotourism could be more developed. Additionally, the results can be used for managers and planners working in local and central governments and other non-governmental organizations. These integrated approaches cover complex and universal issues such as sustainable development of ecotourism, biodiversity conservation and protected area management in a tropical and developing country such as Thailand. Moreover, it is believed that this study can be used as a basis for evaluating the suitability of other areas for ecotourism.

Ecological land change can lead to a series of eco-environmental problems, including water shortages, soil erosion, increased drought intensity, ecosystem damage, and biodiversity loss. Based on relevant sets of big data, including spatial land data, soil data, DEM, climatic data, and socio-economic data, this study explores the factors influencing ecological land change during the period of 2000–2005 in China's Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei Region. The results show that the factors influencing different types of ecological land change have substantial differences. For forest land coverage change, Slope type, Soil organic matter (SOM) content, Farmer's population percentage, and Landform type are the most important independent variables. However, for grassland change, altitude, distance to the primary road and GDP per capita are the most important spatial determinants. Regarding the wetland change, farmer's population percentage, GDP per capita and altitude are the most important factors influencing wetland changes. This study indicates that natural and social-economic factors can affect ecological land change in China's Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei Region. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In a circular economy material loops are closed by recycling of pre-consumer manufacturing scrap/residues, urban mining of End-of-Life products and landfill mining of historic (and future) urban waste streams. However, in the past landfill mining was not performed with a focus on resource recovery. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the concept of Enhanced Landfill Mining, defined as the safe conditioning, excavation and integrated valorization of landfilled waste streams as both materials and energy, using innovative transformation technologies and respecting the most stringent social and ecological criteria. The feasibility of ELFM is studied by synthesizing the research on the Closing the Circle project, the first ELFM project targeting the 18 million metric ton landfill in Houthalen-Helchteren in the East of Belgium. It is argued that Environmental Impact Assessments of ELFM projects should be wide in scope and time. Embedded in a broad resource management perspective, the worldwide potential of ELFM is highlighted, in terms of climate gains, materials and energy utilization, job creation and land reclamation. The potential is quantified for the EU-27 with its 150,000-500,000 landfills. However, for ELFM to reach its full potential, strategic policy decisions and tailored support systems, including combined incentives for material recycling, energy utilization and nature restoration, are required. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is one of the key tools for the evaluation of the environmental sustainability of the agricultural sector. LCA related to milk production has gained attention in recent years, but the results are often discordant and conditioned by the practitioners’ choices. This has made it difficult to clearly identify the most environmentally friendly way to produce milk. In the present paper, 44 milk LCA studies published after 2009 are reviewed, in order to evaluate the level of harmonization and comparability of methods and results, and to discuss emerging issues and hot topics that would be worth further investigation. Furthermore, the effects that the choice of functional unit and allocation rule could have on the results were statistically analyzed. The understanding of the current research direction of milk-LCA studies is useful to promote a more responsible and sustainable livestock production in the perspective of increasing animal protein demand. This review highlighted the difficulties encountered in comparing milk LCA studies, underlining the importance of practitioners’ choices in determining the results. Harmonization among LCA studies applied to the milk sector still represents a goal to be achieved. It appeared that future LCAs should investigate a broad range of impact categories, including biodiversity and water consumption; define one or more common functional units; improve transparency, giving a detailed description of system boundaries and reporting the method used for impact calculation; and systematically conduct a sensitivity analysis for a better understanding of the effects of the choices of method. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper argues that a sustainable ecosystem management approach is vital to ensure the delivery of essential 'life support' ecosystem services and must be mainstreamed into societal conscience, political thinking and economic processes. Feeding the world at a time of climate change, environmental degradation, increasing human population and demand for finite resources requires sustainable ecosystem management and equitable governance. Ecosystem degradation undermines food production and the availability of clean water, hence threatening human health, livelihoods and ultimately societal stability. Degradation also increases the vulnerability of populations to the consequences of natural disasters and climate change impacts. With 10 million people dying from hunger each year, the linkages between ecosystems and food security are important to recognize. Though we all depend on ecosystems for our food and water, about seventy per cent of the estimated 1.1 billion people in poverty around the world live in rural areas and depend directly on the productivity of ecosystems for their livelihoods. Healthy ecosystems provide a diverse range of food sources and support entire agricultural systems, but their value to food security and sustainable livelihoods are often undervalued or ignored. There is an urgent need for increased financial investment for integrating ecosystem management with food security and poverty alleviation priorities. As the world's leaders worked towards a new international climate change agenda in Cancun, Mexico, 29 November-10 December 2010 (UNFCCC COP16), it was clear that without a deep and decisive post-2012 agreement and major concerted effort to reduce the food crisis, the Millennium Development Goals will not be attained. Political commitment at the highest level will be needed to raise the profile of ecosystems on the global food agenda. It is recommended that full recognition and promotion be given of the linkages between healthy, protected ecosystems and global food security; that sufficient resources be allocated for improved ecosystem valuation, protection, management and restoration; and that ecosystem management be integrated in climate change and food security portfolios. We will not be able to feed the world and eradicate extreme poverty, if we do not protect our valuable ecosystems and biodiversity. © 2011 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The European Union's REACH regulation has introduced Socio-Economic Analyses as a new decision support tool in the domain of chemical policy-making. This paper presents a pragmatic method to review the replacement of chemicals in processes or products in terms of the environmental impact. The aim of this work is to develop a broadly accepted method for environmental impact assessment as part of Socio-Economic Analyses. The method consists of a stepwise and tiered approach for Environmental Impact Assessment whereby the expected impact of the replacement of chemicals is assessed via Risk Characterization Ratios and toxic pressure quantification (expressed as a Potentially Affection Fraction of species), and - if relevant - via a Persistency, Bioaccumulation potential and Toxicity score. The working of the method is demonstrated by the replacement of chemical substances in detergents, gutters and Expanded Polystyrene. Of the three replacements, for gutters, the reduction of the toxic pressure on the aquatic compartment was highest. Based on 50% effect concentrations the Potentially Affection Fraction of species due to the use of zinc gutters was relatively high (15%), while it was 0.6% after replacement by PVC gutters. This indicates that PVC gutters have a lower direct impact on aquatic biodiversity than zinc gutters. This paper demonstrates that even with limited data the proposed method can be used to move from risk indicators to impact indicators. The tiered approach allows finding the most appropriate level of analysis in a cost and resource efficient way. The method allows comparison of results of different scenarios and as such allows selecting the most preferable alternative from an environmental perspective. This is useful in the context of socio-economic analysis and as such, this method is available as a decision-support tool under REACH and other chemical policy frames such as the United Nations Environment Program. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {China provides a stark and globally significant illustration of how changing patterns of food production and consumption (especially related to increased intake of animal protein) are creating negative impacts on biodiversity, climate, nitrogen and phosphorous cycles and the use of freshwater. However, China's rapidly growing innovation capabilities and dynamic pattern of development also offer a unique opportunity for transitions towards more sustainable and resilient agri-food systems. Applying a ‘food practices in transition’ framework (Spaargaren et al., 2012), this paper discusses the technological, political and socio-cultural factors central to such systemic changes, with a focus on maize as a core case study. In particular it presents and discusses two contending (but not mutually-exclusive) pathways towards more sustainable maize production and consumption. One, which we call the ‘indigenous innovation’ pathway is framed by ‘systemic rationalities’ and characterised by a focus on R&D-intensive technologies for agricultural intensification, including the controversial use of transgenic phytase maize. The second, which we term the ‘alternative’ pathway, is framed by ‘lifeworld rationalities’ and focusses on improved management practices, shorter supply chains, agro-ecological and participatory research. The two pathways claim different environmental benefits and present different risks and political implications. This paper analyses the food practices in transition in each pathway, identifying links with shifting political conditions and pointing to the increasingly significant role of consumer agency in steering patterns of maize production and consumption in China. © 2016 The Authors},

	abstract = {Abstract Excessive wood consumption for energy and over-dependence on fossil fuel-based energy are fundamental issues of importance regarding the destruction of environmental sanity. In this respect, international communities are seeking to explore opportunities on how to encourage aggressive deployment of technologies for clean and sustainable development and possibly renewable. The Kyoto protocol on climate change meeting in 1997 with about 160 countries in attendance has been used as one of the platform of discourse on carbon emissions reduction strategies. Advocated strategies agreed include increase in renewable energy consumption via modern techniques. Massive deployment of renewable energy systems on a global scale will ensure a reasonable displacement of oil based energy production which is the main source of anthropogenic Greenhouse Gases. In sub-Saharan Africa, limited access to modern energy in the region has stepped-up reliance on bioenergy consumption in form of wood fuel and charcoal resulting to attendant effects on human health, environment and the biodiversity in general. In view of the foregoing, this study presents a review on the current situations of unconstructive effects in the overuse of fuel wood and its charcoal derivative for energy consumption in three selected sub-Saharan African countries; Nigeria, Ghana and Uganda. In conclusion, suggestions on how to confront the challenges associated with the over-exploitation conditions of fuel wood in the region are put forward. The suggestions could be part of the pursuit to increase electricity availability, reliability and security with lower level of emissions in the region. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Population growth and the consequent increase in food demand will certainly intensify the threat to the environment. Brazil, the fourth largest producer and exporter of swine meat, has an important role to ensure the fulfillment of the goals of food security and climate change mitigation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the environmental impact of swine production in Brazil based on life cycle assessment, comparing four manure management systems: liquid manure storage in slurry tanks; the biodigestor by flare; the biodigestor for energy purposes; and composting. Additionally, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the uncertainty due to different emissions factors to estimate nitrogen-related emissions from the manure-handling stage. The functional unit considered was 1000 kg of swine carcass in the equalization chamber for cutting or further distribution. The results indicated an environmental profile of swine production in Brazil of 3503.29 kg of CO2 eq. for climate change, 76.13 kg of SO2 eq. for terrestrial acidification, 2.15 kg of P eq. for freshwater eutrophication, 12.33 kg of N eq. for marine eutrophication, 21,521.12 MJ for cumulative energy demand, 1.63 kg of 1.4-DB eq. for terrestrial ecotoxicity, 1706.26 BDP for biodiversity damage potential and 14.99 m2 for natural land transformation. Feed production had a significant contribution with a range of 17.6-99.5% for all environmental impact categories. Deforestation represented 9.5 and 31.3% of the total impacts for cumulative energy demand and climate change, respectively. Therefore, avoiding the use of grain from deforested areas can significantly decrease the impacts for these impact categories. Regarding the uncertainty analysis, we observed greater variations for terrestrial acidification in slurry tanks, biodigestor by flare and for energy purposes, while for the case of composting, major uncertainties were observed for climate change. For manure management systems, efforts should be made to reduce the emissions of methane in the storage and ammonia in the field application. In this sense, the comparative life cycle assessment indicated that the biodigestor for energy purposes had the best environmental performance for almost all the environmental impacts, mainly due to the biogas capture and the potential of energy saves. Nevertheless, if the goal is to decrease the impacts for terrestrial acidification and marine eutrophication, the slurry tanks is the most preferable scenario compared to all alternative options. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Ecosystem services losses have worsened already serious urban problems such as heat island effects, urban flooding, and biodiversity losses. Urban ecological infrastructure (UEI) is the main carrier of ecosystem services in urban areas and provides a promising approach to combat such urban challenges and at the same time increases urban sustainability and resilience. The objectives of this special volume (SV) were to provide systematic reviews and discussions of the new governance, engineering and technologies available for improving UEI, which can be used to promote the development application of improved urban ecological engineering theories, methods and tools. Seven themes are included in this SV: (1) From civil infrastructure to ecological infrastructure: diagnoses and remedies of urban illnesses; (2) International experiences and lessons in urban “green-blue” ecological engineering to develop and to enforce standards for restoration of natural and social ecosystem services; (3) Implementation of integrated urban waste management, recycling and treatment policies and facilities; (4) Design and modify urban impervious surfaces through ecological engineering; (5) Urban aorta ecology, ecological mobility and livable corridors; (6) Integrative design criteria and cases of urban ecological infrastructure management; (7) The roles of urban ecological infrastructure in industrial parks and industrial clusters. This SV included forty-one, high-quality papers on theories and practices in UEI and in urban sustainability. Concepts, principles, theories, innovative assessment models, successful experiences, barriers to and enablers of UEI implementation were discussed. The authors provide a solid foundation and foster new inspiration to catalyze more ecologically sound and sustainable urbanization. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Organically produced food is often considered more environmentally friendly than conventionally produced food, and Germany is one of the most important and rapidly growing markets for organic food in Europe. However, the carbon footprints and land use of organic diets, and how they compare to conventional diets, have not yet been quantified. Using food consumption data from the German National Nutrition Survey II, and carbon footprint and land-use data from life cycle assessment studies of conventional and organic food products, carbon footprints and land use of conventional and organic diets in Germany were calculated for three consumer categories: men, women and their combined unweighted average. Conventional diets are defined as the average diet of consumers who do not buy organic food products; organic diets are the average diets of consumers whose food purchases include a large share of organic food products. Greenhouse gas emissions associated with land use change are not included. The carbon footprints of the average conventional and organic diets are essentially equal (ca. 1250 CO2-eq cap−1 year−1), while the land use to provide food is ca. 40% greater in the organic diet (ca. 1900 and 2750 m2 of land cap−1 year−1 in the conventional and organic diets, respectively). The average conventional diet contains 45% more meat than the average organic diet, which on the other hand contains 40% more vegetables, fruits, and legumes (combined). Animal-based food products dominate the carbon footprints and land use (ca. 70–75%) in both diets. The organic diet, in particular that of women, is more aligned with health-based dietary guidelines. Diet-related carbon footprints and land use can be reduced by shifting toward diets with less animal-based food products (other measures are also discussed). General conclusions about the overall performance of conventional and organic agriculture are not supported by this study since only carbon footprints and land use were assessed, while other important issues, such as biodiversity, ecotoxicity impacts and animal welfare, were not considered. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {No consensus has been yet achieved among Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) practitioners on how to assess the impact on biodiversity due to land uses and land use changes, in particular with regard to agricultural areas. In the domain of nature conservation and landscape ecology, spectral heterogeneity (SH) derived from remotely sensed imagery is considered a viable proxy for species diversity detection. The assessment rationale is based on the ‘spectral variation hypothesis’: the higher the spectral variability, the higher the ecological heterogeneity and species community diversity, occupying different niches. Our hypothesis is that SH can be effective to improve or complement current Life Cycle Impact Assessment−LCIA practice on biodiversity loss evaluation driven by land use. Hence, we aim here to explore this assumption by computing SH at a local scale of crops cultivation in Southern Alps (Trentino province, Italy), and then combining this information with land use over 30 years. We observe and analyse the relationships between land cover maps and habitat heterogeneity at different time and spatial resolutions. This allows us to argue about the robustness of SH to be a potential surrogate of environmental nuances for species variability detection in LCIA. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing concern from the scientific community regarding the significant environmental impacts of animal agriculture. In order to draw consumer attention to this issue, there have been a number of initiatives, such as ecolabeling, that seek to influence consumer purchasing behavior. The growth in popularity of smartphone apps has also led to the creation of apps that aim to assist consumers in making more sustainable and greener choices. The Dutch animal welfare non-governmental organization, Varkens in Nood, set out to create an app that would incorporate both specific life cycle environmental and animal welfare impacts of animal products and alternatives and that would allow consumers to access this information while shopping. The life cycle assessment portion of the study was conducted by CE Delft and involved the modeling of the life cycle environmental impacts of 106 different animal products and animal product alternatives from the farm to the supermarket. Given the breadth of animal products and alternatives studied, the database could be used to model over 19,000 individual products available in Dutch supermarkets. The impacts of the life cycles were assessed using a customized version of the ReCiPe (hierarchic endpoint) method. The results show that there are large differences between the product groups, but also within product groups. The main causes for the differences in biodiversity, climate change and land use change are as a result of the differences in livestock management, feed, feed conversion and greenhouse gas production by ruminants. The project also showcases how the needs of the future app user affected the setup of the study, both in the technical database aspects and in keeping the data robust yet simple to understand for the consumer. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {In this review, we present the recent developments and future prospects of improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in crops using various complementary approaches. These include conventional breeding and molecular genetics, in addition to alternative farming techniques based on no-till continuous cover cropping cultures and/or organic nitrogen (N) nutrition. Whatever the mode of N fertilization, an increased knowledge of the mechanisms controlling plant N economy is essential for improving NUE and for reducing excessive input of fertilizers, while maintaining an acceptable yield and sufficient profit margin for the farmers. Using plants grown under agronomic conditions, with different tillage conditions, in pure or associated cultures, at low and high N mineral fertilizer input, or using organic fertilization, it is now possible to develop further whole plant agronomic and physiological studies. These can be combined with gene, protein and metabolite profiling to build up a comprehensive picture depicting the different steps of N uptake, assimilation and recycling to produce either biomass in vegetative organs or proteins in storage organs. We provide a critical overview as to how our understanding of the agro-ecophysiological, physiological and molecular controls of N assimilation in crops, under varying environmental conditions, has been improved. We have used combined approaches, based on agronomic studies, whole plant physiology, quantitative genetics, forward and reverse genetics and the emerging systems biology. Long-term sustainability may require a gradual transition from synthetic N inputs to legume-based crop rotation, including continuous cover cropping systems, where these may be possible in certain areas of the world, depending on climatic conditions. Current knowledge and prospects for future agronomic development and application for breeding crops adapted to lower mineral fertilizer input and to alternative farming techniques are explored, whilst taking into account the constraints of both the current world economic situation and the environment. © 2011 by the authors.},

Protected areas were recently increased by more than 3 million hectares, for a current total of more than 25 million hectares, corresponding to 174 protected areas that cover 12.90% of the country's surface area. The information obtained by research helps us understand both biodiversity and ecological processes, as well as the social and economic phenomena that influence the use of ecosystems. In Mexico there are four species of deer: white-tailed deer, mule deer, red brocket and brown brocket. These ungulates have been an important part of the diet of indigenous people and rural communities, and represent an important resource for sport and trophy hunting. We found the best deer populations in protected areas; these can therefore maintain the gene pool and serve as source populations for other areas. These populations are also useful from a research perspective. People living in some protected areas continue to use natural resources such as deer, and also receive economic inputs to develop ecotourism programs, and support from the government for the environmental services derived from conserving biodiversity. © 2012 by the authors.},

This introductory paper summarises the key issues addressed in the individual papers of this SV, which present a balance between methodological and applied studies. The application of LCA to agro-food systems exemplifies a dynamic and productive interaction between scientific disciplines that previously led separate lives. As a result, LCA in the agro-food sector leads LCA methodological developments on topics such as the attributional versus consequential debate, land use changes, impacts on biodiversity, biotic resource depletion, water use, soil quality, and modelling of direct emissions of crop and animal production systems. Future challenges for the LCA Food research and development domain concern the following issues: functional unit and multi-functionality, emission models, land occupation and transformation, LCA for low-income countries, resilience of agro-food systems and presentation and transparency of results. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, the expansion of land degradation into the PAs is exerting pressure on biodiversity conservation efforts. This degradation is partially the result of mismanagement: the utilization of the land is often unmatched with the inherent suitability of the land. Identification of the spatial distribution of suitable areas for cropland is essential for sustainable land-use recommendation. This paper aims to delineate the areas suitable for cropland in the Tam Dao National Park (TDNP) region using a GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation of biophysical factors and Landsat ETM+ imagery. GIS is used to generate the factors, while MCE is used to aggregate them into a land suitability index. The results indicate the location and extent of crop farming areas at different suitability levels, i.e., most suitable (28.10%), moderately suitable (23.96%), marginally suitable (28.77%), and least suitable (19.17%). The current cropland covers 46.5% of the study area, while most and moderately suitable areas are estimated to be 52.06% of the territory. The results can be used to identify priority areas for crop farming and sustainable land-use management. The GIS-MCE approach provides an effective assessment tool for land-use managers working in protected areas of Vietnam. © 2010 by the authors.},

When restoration projects use project-specific goals to define activities and gauge success without considering broader ecological context, determination of project implications and success can be confounding. We used case studies from the Middle Rio Grande (MRG), southwest USA, to demonstrate how restoration outcomes can rank inconsistently when narrowly-based goals are used. Resource managers have chosen MRG for restoration due to impacts to the natural flood regime, reduced native tree recruitment, and establishment of non-native plants. We show restoration "success" ranks differently based upon three goals: increasing biodiversity, increasing specific ecosystem functions, or restoring native communities. We monitored 12 restored and control sites for seven years. Treatments ranked higher in reducing exotic woody populations, and increasing proportions of native plants and groundwater salvage, but generally worse at removing fuels, and increasing species and habitat structural diversity. Managers cannot rely on the term "restoration" to sufficiently describe a project's aim. Specific desired outcomes must be defined and monitored. Long-term planning should include flexibility to incorporate provisions for adaptive management to refine treatments to avoid unintended ecological consequences. © 2012 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Biological monitoring is a powerful tool for understanding ecological patterns and processes, implementing sound management practices, and determining wildlife conservation strategies. In Mexico, regional long-term bird monitoring has been undertaken only over the last decade. Two comprehensive programs have incorporated bird monitoring as the main tool for assessing the impact of human productive activities on birds and habitats at local and regional levels: the Integrated Ecosystem Management (IEM) and the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor Mexico (CBMM). These programs are implemented in supremely important biodiverse regions in the southern and southeastern states of Mexico. Bird monitoring activities are based on the recruitment and participation of local people linked to sustainable productive projects promoted by the CBMM or IEM. Through a series of training workshops delivered by specialists, local monitors receive equipment and coordinate to become part of a large monitoring network that facilitates regional covertures. This data currently being obtained by local people will enable the mid- and long-term assessment of the impacts of sustainable human productive activities on birds and biodiversity. Community-based bird monitoring programs are a promising opportunity for enhancing scientific knowledge, improving sustainable practices, and supporting wildlife conservation in areas of high biodiversity. © 2012 by the authors.},

This article presents a case study of the use of one hectare (ha) of forest managed for the production of wood for bioenergy production. Both permanent and temporary changes in above-ground biomass are assessed together with the impact on biodiversity caused by LULUC as a result of forestry activities. The impact is measured as a product of time and area requirements, as well as by changes in carbon pools and impacts on biodiversity as a consequence of different management options. To elaborate the usefulness of the method as well as its dependency on assumptions, a range of scenarios are introduced in the study. The results show that the impact on climate change from LULUC dominates the results, compared to the impact from forestry operations. This clearly demonstrates the need to include LULUC in an LCA of forestry products. For impacts both on climate change and biodiversity, the results show large variability based on what assumptions are made; and impacts can be either positive or negative. Consequently, a mere measure of land used does not provide any meaning in LCA, as it is not possible to know whether this contributes a positive or negative impact. © 2011 by Yale University.},

To address this, our paper introduces a new development in the natural sciences - the delineation of nine 'Planetary Boundaries' which govern life as we know it. We call for more systemic research that measures the impact of companies on boundary processes that are at, or possibly beyond, three threshold points - climate change, the global nitrogen cycle, and rate of biodiversity loss - and closing in on others. We also discuss practical implications of the Planetary Boundaries framework for corporate sustainability, including governance and institutional challenges. © 2012 The Authors Journal of Management Studies © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.},

This paper presents a method to assess whether the pressures exerted by a business and its value chain on biodiversity are compatible with biodiversity conservation.

This approach is illustrated based on the case study of a mass-market retailer with a focus on the pressures exerted by its food portfolio at the agricultural production step. The results indicate that several pressures driving biodiversity loss are not sustainable. The study also highlights the prominent weight of a few product categories in the ecological burden.

	abstract = {Land demand is driven by an increasing population and changing consumption patterns. When land is required Land Use Changes (LUC) are triggered, causing several environmental and social impacts. Particularly topical is the assessment of indirect LUC effects. Several methodological approaches have been proposed for carrying out the assessment. In this paper we classified LUC models for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) applications into three main categories: Economic, Causal-Descriptive and Normative models. Six models were selected as representative of these three categories and compared according to fifteen criteria covering: modeling framework, impact categories assessed and model transparency. The results show that, progresses have been made in the Economic General Equilibrium Models and the Causal-Descriptive Models compared. Causal-Descriptive models appear more suitable for long-term assessments in the LCA context while the compared economic models are more suitable for short/medium-term assessments of LUC consequences. As LUC dynamics involve interdisciplinary knowledge, a combination of economic, biophysical and statistical data is however required to achieve a robust assessment of complex LUC dynamics. There is still considerable scope for improving current LUC models. In particular, there is room for improving precision of data, identification of marginal land and inclusion of a broader range of impact categories. Current models mainly focus on GHG emission-related impacts and rarely on other environmental impacts such as nutrient leaching, biodiversity impacts and water resource depletion. Socio-economic analyses of LUC patterns are currently excluded from LCA analysis, preventing a holistic assessment of land occupation impacts. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This study provides decision makers with a data-driven tool as a valid support to institutional action in planning and implementing policies. The probabilistic network model here proposed is built using (1) historical data and (2) a general taxonomy on world resource conflicts. Predicting the most likely conflict outcome is a prerequisite for carrying out some scenario building, which is also illustrated in the paper. However, the strength of our study lies not only in the prediction model, which takes into account specific political, socio-economic and geographical features of the areas involved in resource conflicts, but also in the statistical approach proposed herein for assessing the impact of various policy decisions on conflict dynamics and outcome. The empirical analysis shows that economic and social factors play a central role not only as triggers of claims on the use of natural resources, but also on the salience and persistence of the conflict. Moreover, from scenario simulations it appears that bilateral negotiations most likely drive conflicts in coastal areas (biodiversity protection etc.) to end with an agreement between the parties. Not only the importance of economic interests on coastlines is much higher than in other areas, but also issues on the preservation of natural site and biodiversity are more likely to insist on littorals than in a general framework. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to assess the potential environmental impacts of producing maize, grass-clover, ryegrass, and straw from winter wheat as biomass feedstocks for biorefinery. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method included the following impact categories: Global Warming Potential (GWP100), Eutrophication Potential (EP), Non-Renewable Energy use (NRE), Potential Fresh Water Ecotoxicity (PFWTox) and Potential Biodiversity Damages (PBD). The results showed that GWP100 (in kg CO2 eq, including contribution from soil carbon change) for producing 1 ton of dry matter (t DM) was highest for ryegrass, grass-clover and maize, and lowest for straw. The carbon footprints of ryegrass, grass-clover and maize were affected by including the contribution from soil organic carbon (SOC) changes. Nitrous oxide emissions and emissions related to the production of agro-chemicals (including N-fertilizer) were other hotspots in the carbon footprint. The EP calculated per t DM was highest for grass-clover, ryegrass and maize, and was lowest for straw. NRE use (MJ eq/t DM) was highest for ryegrass, grass-clover and maize and lowest for straw. Major hotspots were diesel use for field operations and agro-chemicals production. The PBD, expressed as Potentially Disappeared Fraction (PDF) showed the highest adverse impact to biodiversity in maize, followed by straw, whereas the results showed relatively lower impact for ryegrass and grass-clover. The PFWTox (CTUe/t DM), at farm level was highest for straw, followed by maize, whereas the values were significantly lower for grass-clover and ryegrass. These variations in ranking of the different biomasses productions using different impact categories for environmental performance showed that it is important to consider a wider range of impact categories for assessing environmental sustainability. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The use of forest and agricultural residues for energy production presents multiple benefits, but the link between bioenergy and the environment is complex and not all of the energetic options have the same impacts. This work evaluates the net positive effect of valorizing residual biomass in the context of a rural area of Portugal, Estremoz. It focuses on the combined assessment of biomass availability, techno-economic feasibility and environmental aspects of utilizing forest and agricultural residues to produce bioheat. At first, the energy potential of the residual biomass available in the municipality is evaluated using a geographical information system database. The assessment with RETScreen of the techno-economic feasibility of replacing electricity by biomass for heating local public schools follows. The results show that around 27 314 t of residues, corresponding to about 267 680 GJ, are produced each year in Estremoz, more than half in montado areas. The use of this biomass for the replacement of the existing electric heating systems of nine local schools by biomass-based ones offers good project profitability. As far as the environment is concerned, the energetic valorization of the residual biomass in Estremoz has multiple benefits. It contributes to climate change mitigation by saving greenhouse gas emissions and promoting the preservation of the traditional extensive uses of the ecosystems. Moreover, a correct vegetation management decreases the fire risk, potentiates the increase in biodiversity, offers better conditions for native species and allows to maintain the ecosystems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {This paper explores the potential of minimizing wood waste to reduce the environmental impact in the timber sector i.e. forestry and timber industry subsystem of Ghana. This study is a follow up of 3 earlier studies on the timber sector. These studies consistently identified minimizing wood waste as a major point of departure for reducing the environmental impact of timber sector of Ghana. When wood waste generated by the 5 wood products were further compared for 3 different functional units (m 3, kg or €). The chosen functional unit was sensitive to the wood waste impact results. The results of our study show that combining technological changes, good operational practices and recycling measures could reduce wood waste by approximately 50%. We therefore conclude that the reduction of wood waste in the timber sector may also reduce the other environmental impacts in the timber sector. Since our earlier studies established that wood wastes may function as a reasonable single indicator for land use as proxy for biodiversity loss and the other impact categories. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The disruption of nutrient cycles caused by human activities such as agriculture and burning fossil fuels is impacting ecosystem services on global and local scales. The increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere contributes to rising global temperatures and ocean acidification, whereas the accumulation of nutrients in water systems is leading to degradation of water quality and biodiversity. City populations play a major role in carbon dioxide and nutrient emissions as ‘end consumers’ of resources. The current challenge towards more resource-efficient cities is to transform urban metabolism from linear to cyclical. Discharged nutrients and carbon dioxide can be used as input for algae, which fixate carbon very efficiently into energetic storage compounds as starch or lipids. However, cities often lack the space to implement large-scale algae production. This article evaluates the potential of reusing nutrients and carbon dioxide to produce algae, food and biofuel on water nearby coastal and delta cities. First, nutrients and carbon dioxide discharge is estimated and two scenarios are developed. From the cities nutrient production, the potential algal yield is evaluated and translated into feed, food and oil yields. Two delta cities are chosen as case studiesRotterdam and Metro Manila. The conclusion of this article is that Floating Production can help cities increasing their resilience in the field of food and energy. Floating Production can also contribute to a solution for global land shortage. The combination of food and energy production with floating urban development provides a climate-proof urban expansion in delta and coastal areas. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The environmental impact of 12 dairy farms in Denmark, Germany and Italy was evaluated using an LCA approach and the most important parameters influencing their environmental sustainability were identified. The farms represent different production methods (organic vs. conventional), summer feeding systems (confinement vs. pasture) and annual production levels (6275-10,964 kg ECM cow-1). There was large variability in stocking rates (1.1-11.0 LU ha-1) among farms, which has a major impact on the production per unit area of farmland, on feed self-sufficiency and on farm surplus of nitrogen. The proportion of grassland on farmland used for forage production or pasture varied from 0 to 100%. The lowest global warming potential (GWP), acidification, eutrophication and non-renewable energy use were achieved by the German pasture-based system, followed by the Danish organic dairy system and the very intensive Italian farming system with very similar environmental impact values. However, a sensitivity analysis showed that when emissions relating to direct land use change of soybean production were included in the assessment, the GWP changed considerably for the conventional farms due to the inclusion of conventional soymeal in the feed concentrate. There were strong and positive correlations between the four impact categories, and overall the results indicate that improving greenhouse gas emissions would improve the general environmental sustainability of the dairy farm. The land occupation was lowest in the farms with the highest stocking rate. The organic Danish farms had the lowest impact on biodiversity loss, which in general was positively influenced by the share of grassland in the system. A high proportion of grassland also had a significant positive effect on GWP, acidification and energy use. The other feature that mainly improved the environmental impact was the feed efficiency of the dairy cows, which was negatively correlated with GWP, acidification and eutrophication. We found no relation between the environmental impact and the milk production per cow or the stocking rate at the farm. However, due to the limited number of observations (only 12 farms were assessed), the results of the correlation analyses should be handled with care. There was also large variation in the relative contributions from on- and off-farm activities among farms and for the different impact categories, showing the importance of a holistic approach and the difficulties in evaluating a farming system both in a product and area-based perspective. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We measured the cradle-to-grave PCF of German strawberries, asparagus, roses and orchids in different production systems and compared it to the PCF of the same products grown in other countries. For the production and customer stage we collected primary data, for the comparison with products in other countries we used literature data. The results showed that the average consumer stage constitutes 3e71% of the PCF, the best case consumer scenario 1e39% and the worst case 60e99%. The consumer shopping trip was a hotspot in all analysed systems where a private car was used. Electricity for production, fuel use for soil management, and cooking and washing dishes were also among the most often identified hotspots. German open field strawberries perform better, German open field roses and asparagus are on the similar level with the same products produced abroad. However, asparagus transported by plane, and strawberries and roses grown in greenhouses have several times higher PCF regardless of the producing country. Consumers as well as producers are responsible for reducing the climate impact of horticultural products. Shopping trip on foot or by bike and using renewable energy can reduce the PCF significantly. We recommend extending the analysis to the life cycle assessment or product environmental footprint to consider more indicators to identify which products are less harmful to the environment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Two most critical factors to address in environmental system analysis of future milk production are 1) the link between milk and beef production, and 2) the competition for land, possibly leading to land use change (LUC) with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and loss of biodiversity as important implications. Different methodological approaches concerning these factors, in studies on environmental impacts of dairy production, sometimes lead to contradictory results. Increasing milk yield per cow is often one of the solutions discussed in order to reduce GHG emissions from milk production. However, when also accounting for other systems affected (e.g. beef production) it is not certain that an increase in milk yield per cow leads to a reduction in total GHG emissions per kg milk. In the present study the correlation between carbon footprint (CF) of milk and the amount of milk delivered per cow is investigated for 23 dairy farms (both organic and conventional) in Sweden. Use of a fixed allocation factor of 90% (based on economic value) indicates a reduction in CF with increased milk yield, while no correlation can be noted when system expansion is applied. The average CF for two groups of farms, organic and high yielding conventional, is also calculated. When conducting system expansion the CF is somewhat lower for the organic farms (which have a lower milk yield per cow, but more meat per kg milk), but when a 90% allocation factor is used, the CF is somewhat higher for the organic farms compared to the high yielding conventional farms. In analysis of future strategies for milk production, it is suggested that system expansion should be applied, in order to also account for environmental impacts from affected systems. Thus, scenarios for milk and meat production should be analysed in an integrated approach in order to reduce total emissions from the livestock sector. How to account for emissions from LUC is highly debated and there is no current shared consensus. Different LUC methods result in significantly different results. In this study, four different LUC methods are applied, using data for organic milk production and high yielding conventional milk production systems in Sweden. Depending on which LUC method was applied, the organic system showed about 50% higher or 40% lower CF compared to the conventional high yielding system. Thus, when reporting CF numbers, it is important to report LUC-factors separately and clearly explain the underlying assumptions, since the method of accounting for LUC can drastically change the results. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The first life cycle impact assessment for redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) forest management activities (i.e. a cradle-to-sawmill gate input) including the growing, harvesting, and hauling of redwood sawlogs to a sawmill was completed. In the stump-to-truck timber harvesting analysis, primary transport activities such as skidding and yarding consumed the largest amount of fuel and consequently generated the greatest environmental impacts (50% of the total) compared with the other harvesting stages (felling, processing, and loading). Hauling sawlogs to the sawmill was also a major contributor to total greenhouse gas emissions, representing 20% of total emissions. The most efficient harvest method in terms of fuel consumption per m3 of wood harvested was the manual ground-based system used in even-aged silvicultural operations, followed by the skyline harvesting methods. Relative to even-aged silvicultural systems, uneven-aged systems, often prescribed to meet environmental goals such as maintaining biodiversity and protecting wildlife habitats, used 20% more fuel per m3 of redwood sawlogs harvested. This was because uneven-aged systems required an increased number of entries to harvest the same amount of wood as even-aged systems. The cradle-to-gate GHG emissions from redwood forest management activities including growing, harvesting and hauling the logs represent only 14% (17.13 kg CO2e/m3) of the total GHG emissions (i.e. cradle-to-grave) associated with redwood decking lumber. The study results showed substantial differences in environmental impacts for the various harvesting operations and silvicultural systems for redwood forest management and operations. Therefore, the life cycle impact assessment results for the various redwood harvesting and silvicultural systems should be carefully considered when evaluating environmental performance of forest management activities along with other objectives. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The need to ensure environmental sustainability is a critical challenge for humanity. The forces driving increased environmental pressure are world population growth, economic growth, and increasing urbanization. As a result, demand for base metals, such as iron and copper, used for producing industrial products and infrastructure has been rising. At the same time, biodiversity has ascended the global agenda because of its bearing on sustainability. Industry needs to take into account its impact on biodiversity in terms of product life cycles, from raw material extraction to product retirement. Despite the need to evaluate the influence of industry on biodiversity, a quantitative and practical biodiversity evaluation index has yet to be established. In this study, we focus on base metals that affect biodiversity through mining. This paper presents a new quantitative index, MiBiDTM, which is based on the geographic relationship among land cover, protected areas, and mining operations. Using available global databases, we developed the MiBiD intensity database, which covers over 700 mines of iron, copper, bauxite (aluminum), zinc, and lead around the world. Some findings achieved using the database are shown, such as that the MiBiD intensity of copper is much larger than that of any other mineral on average. Through comparison with existing indices, advantages and disadvantages of MiBiD are discussed. MiBiD is significant because it is the first site-specific global index of the pressure of mining on biodiversity, and it can provide new information for corporate management. © 2014 The Authors.

Under this framework, sustainable livelihood strategies are incorporated into conservation goals on the basis that the integration of local priorities into management guidelines benefits rather than impedes conservation efforts. Consistent with this approach, the Community Nature Reserve of Dindéfélo in Kédougou, Senegal endeavors to protect biodiversity without jeopardizing local people's reliance on natural resources. In this article we provide evidence that sustainable resource conservation is a very powerful mechanism in redirecting labor and capital away from ecosystem-degrading activities. To do this, we present three examples of projects, aiming to illustrate different ways in which local people's management and sustainable use of natural resources can be beneficial in terms of biodiversity conservation, socioeconomic development, and human well-being. © 2012 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Food diet choices can have a considerable effect on climate change as around 15-30% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions correspond to the food sector. Life-cycle assessment has been an effective tool to evaluate the environmental impact of food production, normally using mass as the functional unit (FU). As this is not always able to reproduce the consumption of different foods and their nutritional value, alternative nutrient-related FUs that can do so should be used. The present study assesses, quantifies and compares the nutritional quality and the environmental impact of two different food diets, a Mediterranean diet (MD), which includes meat-source products and fish, and a vegan diet (VD), which only includes plant-based products. The nutritional quality index NRF9.3 and the impact categories of global warming potential (GWP) and regional biodiversity impact (RBI) due to land use (LU) are assessed for both diets. The VD resulted to have a higher nutritional quality than the MD mainly as it contained less disqualifying nutrients like saturated fat, added sugars and sodium and more qualifying nutrients, although some likely micronutrients deficiencies like B12 in the VD are not assessed here. All the environmental impacts were much higher for the MD, mainly due to the presence of livestock products and fish, which on average had the highest GWP and LU values of all products studied. The GWP, mostly dominated by the food production stage compared to cooking and transport, was around twice as high in the MD. The LU, in livestock products dominated by the land requirements of feedcrops in more than a 99%, was around three times higher in the MD. Finally, the RBI of the MD was also around three times higher than the VD's, although this could be underestimated as fish biodiversity has not been assessed. Impact differences between diets increased when impacts were adjusted by the NRF9.3, which demonstrates that the nutritional quality of diets affects the comparison of the environmental impacts. In an attempt to provide a possible solution to the tightly linked diet-environment-health trilemma, it is concluded that a shift towards a mix of these two diets, where all nutrients are consumed in the recommended levels and where only the least environmental impacting livestock products are consumed, would maybe help reducing GHG emissions, deforestation and biodiversity loss, as well as preventing diet-related diseases like diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Total material requirement (TMR), a measure of all of the material input required by a national economy, is sometimes criticized for failing to link material flows within an economy and their global environmental impacts. This article presents a three-step method for bridging this gap. The method shows how to (1) analyze TMR accounts to identify potentially environmentally relevant flows (PERF), that is, material flows with potential environmental impacts abroad; (2) assess the socioenvironmental impacts of the identified PERF; and (3) determine the main economic activities underlying these PERF. Using this method we are able to add an environmental dimension to TMR accounts and to make the connection between economic activities and their socioenvironmental impacts worldwide. This methodology has been applied to the Basque Country (BC) region (Spain). An in-depth analysis of the trends in the TMR of the BC shows that tin imports associated with tin capsule production account for around 7% of the TMR. These high figures are due to the substantial hidden flows (HF) of tin imports, which is an indicator of potential environmental impacts abroad. We find that tin extraction and concentration involve several social and environmental impacts such as waste generation, soil, water, and air pollution affecting biodiversity and human health, and child labor. These impacts are located in Indonesia, China, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Malaysia, and Thailand. ©2009 by Yale University.},

	abstract = {The UNEP/SETAC life cycle initiative has recently proposed a framework for life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) of land use. Still, a lack of appropriate LCIA-methods for assessing land use impacts exist in life cycle assessment (LCA). Most existing methods are either too coarse-grained regarding the differentiation between different land use types (e.g. conventional farming versus organic farming), or they are too narrow regarding spatial coverage (e.g. only part of Europe). Therefore, the purpose of this article is to develop a method that overcomes these problems. A secondary goal is to develop a method for which it is possible to determine characterisation factors for any land use type in any region without the need for overwhelming data and data manipulation requirements. The developed method for LCIA of biodiversity focuses on species richness of vascular plants which can be determined from species-area curves. The category indicator is calculated as the multiplication of occupied area, the number of species affected per standard area (100 m2), the duration of occupation and renaturalisation from transformation, and a factor for ecosystem vulnerability. The main uncertainties of the method are related to the determination of renaturalisation times and the establishment species-area curves. The intention of the study presented in this article, i.e. to develop an applicable model with global coverage and no constraints on resolution regarding spatial and land use type differentiation, has widely been met. The limiting factor for applicability is the access to species richness surveys for the relevant regions and land use types. But still, the method shows that, with limited efforts, it is possible to calculate characterisation factors for a large range of land use types in different parts of the world. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The kraft pulping industry uses considerable amounts of wood as raw material, and regulatory agencies have been tightening their control limits for effluent, solid waste and air emissions. The technological solutions required to reduce the environmental impact of the industry are shown to have the potential of causing social hardship for the mill's employees, the affected communities, lenders, and owners. In some instances, the technological solutions give rise to new environmental challenges. Forestry practices are influencing the public's perception of the kraft pulping industry, its ethical and environmental performance, its profitability, and the properties of its product, which may increase wood requirements. New forestry practices have the potential to reduce the forest land area required to sustain the kraft pulp production at a given level but ethical problems associated with genetic manipulation, phenodiversity, and biodiversity are identified.

Tourism is one of the economic sectors in which a great degree of involvement is needed by the entrepreneurial sector: diversification of tourism products and services is needed to cope with increased demand for new types of tourism needs. These include opportunities for more sustainable tourism. The Söderslätt region of Sweden, which is used as a case study, is a newborn tourist destination with lots of natural and cultural characteristics. It is also one of the most agriculture intensive areas in Sweden where a potential for rural entrepreneurship development can be identified. However, the entrepreneurial culture and climate was poor in the region. This is due to the social pressure that is characteristic for this rural community. This paper shows the results of a SWOT analysis of Söderslätt tourism entrepreneurship development, which gives an overview of their current entrepreneurial situation. The case of a family-based enterprise, "Healthy Pig Farm" is presented as an example of a successful, innovative entrepreneur in farm tourism. Moreover, based on the findings and analyses, several recommendations are proposed to overcome obstacles for sustainable entrepreneurship development in rural tourist areas. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of the special issue is to bring together a series of papers that will form a nucleus for the growth of an emerging area of scholarship. Overfishing and marine habitat damage have generated a global crisis in the production of seafood. In order to respond to this crisis we need systems for the management of seafood production and consumption that will comprehensively reduce and eventually eliminate wastefulness in both capture fisheries and aquaculture systems. Thirteen papers address these issues, with focuses on: seafood harvesting practices, fish processing, life cycle assessment, eco-efficiency, management of wastes, seafood distribution and consumption, total energy costs, eco-labeling, and the conservation of resources and biodiversity. We conclude that major changes are required in our approaches to the management of both the marine environment and our seafood capture and production systems. We also conclude that steps have been taken in this direction, but there is still far to go. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Key issues from the review of methods are: (a) none of the major methods identified can address all relevant issues and questions at once, (b) basing bioproductivity calculations on Net Primary Production (NPP) is a promising approach, (c) advances in linking bioproductivity with ecosystem services and biodiversity have been made by the Dynamic EF concept and the HANPP indicator, (d) environmentally extended input-output analysis (IOA) provides a number of advantages for improving EF calculations and (e) further variations such as the emergy-based concept or the inclusion of further pollutants are not regarded as providing a fundamental shift to the usefulness of EF for policy making.

Although such concerns are traditionally treated as distinct environmental policy areas, the prominence of the paper industry's impacts in each area gave rise to an increasingly integrated environmental perspective fixed on the system of paper production and consumption, and on the paper industry itself. The argument advanced here suggests that the structure of the modern industry itself must be a central focus in a more integrated environmental perspective that can meaningfully accommodate the multiple social, economic, and ecological goals of sustainability. Two issues, paper recycling and the use of nonwood fiber sources, are discussed from this point of view. The article concludes with a discussion of how a sectoral analysis of environmental problems can be used to frame a comprehensive strategic vision of alternative futures in the industry, and to design effective public policies and strategies.},

	abstract = {Alcohol fuel is generally presented as a sustainable fuel in comparison with other fossil fuel due to lower emissions during production and combustion steps as well as due to its (assumed) closed carbon cycle. However, assessing the Brazilian traditional alcohol production cycle, many social and environmental impacts may still be indicated: burning, pesticides, biodiversity, labor exploration, high water consumption, erosion and others. Based on the strategy of an agro-industrial networking and symbiosis, a project was designed to optimize the system by means of polygeneration and total integration of production steps. The case presented in this paper is the project for a social and ecological agro-industry model, named GERIPA (Geração de Energia Renovável Integrada à Produção de Alimentos), which produces renewable fuel, electricity and organic food. Besides the technical project, an economic evaluation is also presented, resulting into a five year pay back time. In addition, environmental and social aspects were evaluated by means the Emergy Synthesis methodology (Odum, 1996), which assesses the value of all inputs through an estimate of the environmental work directly and indirectly required for their production and sustainable supply. The emergy-based comparison of GERIPA system and a traditional system in Brazil indicates better performance of GERIPA, with an eMergy Sustainability Index of 1.26, much higher than for a traditional system, 0.22. The project is presently under discussion with investors and Government and, if approved, will be carried out in marginal and presently unused land. In addition to providing an environmentally friendly process for food and energy production, the project would generate new jobs opportunities for Brazilian rural workers presently unemployed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Their article provides an analysis based on a set of data that could be very useful for discussing the sustainability of economic processes in terms of resource flows and societal relations to nature. The authors' choice to adopt a reductionist analysis of the metabolism of societies in energetic terms - that is, an analysis based on a single-scale and single-variable indicator such as "joules of energy input metabolized per year for the whole society" - is a controversial one. Such a choice implies the aggregation of different types of data (referring to nonequivalent categories of energy inputs) into a single overall assessment. That is, in their study the authors are adopting an old and controversial solution for aggregating different types of energy forms: applying a set of flat conversion factors (calorimetric equivalent) to the different types of energy inputs considered. This commentary discusses the trade-off entailed by any method of aggregation of energy forms of different quality: (i) compression - reducing the number of indices used - versus (ii) relevance - maintaining a diversity of categories needed for the usefulness of the analysis. A brief history of the main strategies adopted, so far, for dealing with the problem of aggregation suggests implications for the approach adopted by Haberl and colleagues. © 2006 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Yale University.},

	abstract = {Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is a technique for systematically analyzing a product from cradle-to-grave, that is, from resource extraction through manufacture and use to disposal. LCA is a mixed or hybrid analytical system. An inventory phase analyzes system inputs of energy and -materials along with outputs of emissions and wastes throughout life cycle, usually as quantitative mass loadings. An impact assessment phase then examines these loadings in light of potential environmental issues using a mixed spectrum of qualitative and quantitative methods.The constraints imposed by inventory's loss of spatial, temporal, dose-response, and threshold information raise concerns about the accuracy of impact assessment. The degree of constraint varies widely according to the environmental issue in question and models used to extrapolate the inventory data. LCA results may have limited value in two areas: (I) local and/or transient biophysical processes and (2) issues involving biological parameters, such as biodiversity, habitat alteration, and toxicity.The end result is that impact assessment does not measure actual effects or impacts, nor does it calculate the likelihood of an effect or risk. Rather, LCA impact assessment results are largely directional environmental indicators.The accuracy and usefulness of indicators need to be assessed individually and in a circumstance-specific manner prior to decision making.This limits LCA's usefulness as the sole basis for comprehensive assessments and the comparisons of alternatives. In conclusion, LCA may identify potential issues from a systemwide perspective, but more-focused assessments using other analytical techniques are often necessary to resolve the issues. © Copyright 1997 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Yale University.},

	abstract = {Interest in producing ethanol from biomass in an attempt to make transportation ecologically sustainable continues to grow. In recent years, a large number of assessments have been conducted to assess the environmental merit of biofuels. Two detailed reviews present contrasting results: one is generally unfavourable, whilst the other is more favourable towards fuel bio-ethanol. However, most work that has been done so far, to assess the conversion of specific feedstocks to biofuels, specifically bio-ethanol, has not gone beyond energy and carbon assessments. This study draws on 47 published assessments that compare bio-ethanol systems to conventional fuel on a life cycle basis, or using life cycle assessment (LCA). A majority of these assessments focused on net energy and greenhouse gases, and despite differing assumptions and system boundaries, the following general lessons emerge: (i) make ethanol from sugar crops, in tropical countries, but approach expansion of agricultural land usage with extreme caution; (ii) consider hydrolysing and fermenting lignocellulosic residues to ethanol; and (iii) the LCA results on grasses as feedstock are insufficient to draw conclusions. It appears that technology choices in process residue handling and in fuel combustion are key, whilst site-specific environmental management tools should best handle biodiversity issues. Seven of the reviewed studies evaluated a wider range of environmental impacts, including resource depletion, global warming, ozone depletion, acidification, eutrophication, human and ecological health, smog formation, etc., but came up with divergent conclusions, possibly due to different approaches in scoping. These LCAs typically report that bio-ethanol results in reductions in resource use and global warming; however, impacts on acidification, human toxicity and ecological toxicity, occurring mainly during the growing and processing of biomass, were more often unfavourable than favourable. It is in this area that further work is needed.},

Findings from a longitudinal discourse analysis of the debate between a leading global forest industry company (Stora Enso) and a global environmental organization (Greenpeace) demonstrate the utility of a research approach that focuses on the discussants' language use.

	abstract = {The environmental impact of land-use can be expressed in terms of a change in biodiversity of flora. We present two models that characterize the negative effects of land-use: a model on the basis of species richness; a model on the basis of the rarity of ecosystems and their vascular plants. Each of those models may serve in the EIA (environmental impact assessment) of the urban and rural planning of expanding cities, industrial areas, road infrastructure, etc. Moreover, these models might be applied by Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) practitioners to incorporate the aspect of land-use in the environmental assessment of a specific product design. The results of both models have been applied in practice. Maps of The Netherlands are provided for both models. The map based on the rarity of ecosystems differentiates the best of what experts (biologists and ecologists) define as botanical quality of nature; the methodology is operational in The Netherlands and might be applied to other countries as well, however, detailed botanical information is required. The map based on species richness has a weaker compliance with the botanical quality of nature, however, the model can more easily be applied to a wider area of the world, since indicative data about species richness is available on a global scale. The so called 'eco-costs of land conversion' is proposed as a single indicator, being the marginal costs of prevention (or compensation) of the negative environmental effects on biodiversity caused by change of land-use. These 'eco-costs of land conversion' for the botanical aspects are part of the much broader model of the eco-costs/value ratio, which has recently been published in this journal [Vogtländer et al., Journal of Cleaner Production 2002;10:57-671]. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {While sustainability is generally associated with the definition of sustainable development given by the Brundtland Commission 'Our common future (1987) Oxford University Press,' namely 'development' that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs,' it is important to recognize that a mathematical theory embodying these concepts would be immensely valuable in humanity's efforts to manage the environment. The concept of sustainability applies to integrated systems comprising humans and the rest of nature. The structures and operation of the human component (in terms of society, economy, law, etc.) must be such that these reinforce or promote the persistence of the structures and operation of the natural component (in terms of ecosystem trophic linkages, biodiversity, biogeochemical cycles, etc.), and vice versa. Thus, one of the challenges of sustainability research lies in linking measures of ecosystem functioning to the structure and operation of the associated social system. We propose that indicators based on Information Theory can bridge the natural and human system elements, and make sense of the disparate state variables of the system. Thus, in this paper we explore the use of Fisher Information, which is a statistical measure of variation, as an aggregating index for dynamic systems of many variables. We have developed a novel application of Fisher Information to time-series data of dynamic systems, which (borrowing from statistical mechanics) uses an ensemble average of the system dynamics. We demonstrate this methodology using an uncalibrated 5-trophic level, 12-compartment (species) food web model with an associated basic social system for the population of omnivores at the top of the food chain. The model has five functional groups: detritus, primary producers, herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores. In addition to a seasonal forcing function, perturbation scenarios involving each of the parts of the system are simulated so as to explore the sustainability of the system under various types of stress, including basic human behaviors, such as agriculture. Since Fisher Information is a measure of the variation, we hypothesize that it is an indicator of system order, and thus system sustainability.

In the study, special focus was aimed at substance flows in concentrate feed production and nutrient flows on the farms. The different feeding strategies in the two forms of production, influence several impact categories. The import of feed by conventional dairy farms often leads to a substantial input of phosphorus and nitrogen. Organic milk production is a way to reduce pesticide use and mineral surplus in agriculture but this production form also requires substantially more farmland than conventional production. For Swedish conditions, however, a large use of grassland for grazing ruminants is regarded positively since this type of arable land use promotes the domestic environmental goals of biodiversity and aesthetic values.},

	abstract = {Degradation of soil quality is a major concern due to the scarcity of fertile land, and needs to be properly addressed in the environmental assessment of agro-forestry systems. This paper addresses the main issues arising in assessing the impacts of fertile land use on "Life Support Functions" in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). These issues include the assessment of occupation and transformation impacts, the references against which such impacts should be measured, and the concept of natural relaxation versus backup technology for recovery from the impacts. The alternative (or reference) situation is defined using the concept of consequential LCA, which facilitates clarification of the allocation issues arising due to successive land uses. This paper presents soil organic matter (SOM) as a robust indicator for soil quality; even though it does not fully consider all aspects of soil functioning, SOM has been often recognised as the best stand-alone indicator for soil quality. Impacts on biodiversity are not included in this indicator and should be assessed in parallel. Alternative data sources for practical implementation of the method are suggested in a hierarchical way, including locally specific data sets describing changes in SOM; mechanistic models for the prediction of SOM evolution; and general data sources for simplified analyses. Thanks to its flexibility in data collection the method is applicable to any agricultural or forestry LCA to fill an important gap in Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) of land use. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Corporate governance changes at two levels. First, the internal governance of the firm alters as new environmental preservation demands come forward. Secondly, the external governance of the firm changes as new initiatives need to be employed to ensure adequate and sustainable social, technological, and infrastructural conditions for production. It is argued that the preservation of non-reproducible 'key stocks' of energy, biodiversity, and space requires new and special attention in the strategic management of the sustainable enterprise. Also, it is shown that evolving ethical values of intergenerational equity demand a timely transition to new business practices.

	abstract = {The foundation for the creation of eco-efficiency metrics for industrial impacts on biodiversity is considered. Because biodiversity is the essence of life itself, these metrics are essential for effectiveness in the theory and practice of eco-efficiency, particularly in the case of primary natural resource extraction industries such as fishing and forestry. The case of fishing is examined, with particular attention to by-catch, lost nets, and habitat damage caused by mobile fishing gears. It is appropriate to examine fishing because industrial era impacts on marine biodiversity have been severe and are driving large and deleterious changes in marine ecosystems. For discarded by-catch, it is proposed that an eco-efficient metric for the value per unit mass of discarded fish can be set to be equivalent to that of the market value of the utilized catch. In estimating the eco-efficient value of the catch, the value of the discarded fish is then subtracted from the market value of the catch. Fish killed in lost nets can be treated similarly. It is more difficult to address marine habitat damage by mobile fishing gear, which has the highest potential for ecological injury. By using the approach proposed, negative eco-efficiencies are obtained under circumstances in which the collateral damage to biodiversity exceeds the economic benefit obtained. This is a logical outcome given the long-term effects of biodiversity decline. A metric is also proposed for assessing whether avoidance of harm to biodiversity, in the form of switching fishing gear, is required. Lastly it is proposed that metrics might be developed to provide eco-efficiency credit for companies taking effective actions to improve, or actively participate in, ecosystem-based fisheries management. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Even so, there is still a considerable lack of definition, particularly concerning what parameters should be considered and - as a result - what particular methodology should be used. This paper presents a review of the different methods proposed for assessing the environmental impact of land use. The methodology is specially developed for assessing endpoint categories such as biodiversity and life support systems. We evaluated the environmental impact associated with protected horticulture and compared it with other forms of human activity. The study was carried out in the area of El Maresme. This has traditionally been an agricultural area, although it is now under heavy pressure from urban and industrial developments due to its proximity to Barcelona. On the basis of the results obtained in the case study, it was demonstrated that agricultural uses ranked at the same level or slightly below those of urban uses, and that both uses clearly scored lower than forest uses, from the point of view of biodiversity. When a productivity indicator was used, agricultural use registered a smaller environmental impact than urban use, but larger than for forestry. Finally, we discuss the problems and limitations encountered when these methods were applied in our case study. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {An integrated environmental and economic assessment of land use for food, energy and timber in the UK has been performed using environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and economic Life Cycle Costing (LCC), to explore complementary sustainability aspects of alternative land uses. The environmental assessment includes impacts on climate change, ecosystem services and biodiversity, all of which include soil carbon emissions. The systems explored include all processes from cradle to farm 'gate'. The crops assessed were wheat and oilseed rape (under both organic and conventional farming systems), Scots Pine, and willow and Miscanthus. Food crops, particularly conventional food crops, are shown to have the highest climate-changing emissions per ha, whereas energy and forestry crops show negative net emissions. To a lesser extent, the same situation applies to impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity, with carbon storage in biomass playing a larger role than carbon in soils. The energy and forestry crops in this study show an overall beneficial environmental impact, in particular due to soil carbon sequestration, making these land uses the lowest contributors to climate change. Combining this with the non-renewable CO2 emissions displaced will mean that energy crops have an even lower impact. Economically, conventional food crops present the highest costs per ha, followed by organic food crops, energy and forestry crops. Integrating the results from LCA and LCC shows that the climate impacts per monetary unit of all land Sustainability 2010, 2 3748uses are dominated by soil management and, in the case of food production, also by fertilisation. Taxes or incentives such as "carbon charging" will encourage changes in practice in these areas to improve the sustainability of land management, mainly by building up Soil Organic Carbon (SOC). © 2010 by the authors.},

Social scientific research is needed to highlight the complex socioeconomic factors that inhibit efforts to initiate PPB programs. To contribute, we offer a case study of a participatory organic seed production project that involved a university breeding program, commercial organic seed dealers, and organic farmers in the Northeastern United States. We demonstrate that, although PPB may indeed promote agricultural biodiversity, several socioeconomic obstacles must be overcome to establish such a program. © 2010 by the authors.},

The context of this change is important. New Zealand is unique in terms of its relative geographic isolation and as a consequence human settlers encountered a unique ecosystem, dominated by avian species and without mammalian predators. Subsequent anthropogenic activity has seriously impacted New Zealand's biodiversity and sustainability is seen by many as a way of restoring, or at least conserving the remnant of that unique ecosystem. The country's natural environment and resources, the shape of business and the health of the economy all colour the way and rate at which sustainability is adopted.

For the first time in human history - we are faced not with just one crisis - but a confluence of several crises; crises that are not related to a single tribe or community - a single nation - or a single region of the world - but are each global in scale. To meet the challenges of these global crises will require an equally historic paradigm shift; a paradigm shift with a strong environmental ethic that restores ecological balance and integrity to our failing ecosystems, and that addresses the critical issue of climate change; a paradigm shift toward an economic system that brings about an end to poverty - and a paradigm that brings an end to war as a means to solving conflict, as it is only through a global family in harmony and peace with itself, that we can solve the unprecedented global issues facing our one common home, planet earth - and our one common future as a global family. The travel and tourism industry has, and will continue to play a vital and leading role toward this paradigm shift, and as the world's largest industry involving virtually every nation in the world - will be the central pillar of a Peace through Commerce movement. The dramatic growth of tourism in the past 60 years is one of the most remarkable economic and social phenomena of our time. The industry has grown from a total of 25 million international arrivals in 1950 to a projected 1 billion international arrivals in 2010, and a further projection to 1. 6 billion by 2020. Beginning with the emergence of "Ecotourism" in the late 1980's, there are an increasing number of tourism market segments which fall within a broad category that can be called "Peace Tourism," and classified within a framework that includes peace within ourselves, peace with others, peace with nature, peace with past generations, peace with future generations, and peace with our Creator. Since its birth in 1986, the International Institute for Peace through Tourism (IIPT) has been promoting these values of tourism together with its vision of Travel and Tourism as the world's first "Global Peace Industry" - an industry that promotes and supports the belief that every traveler is potentially an "Ambassador for Peace." This "higher purpose of tourism" includes the key role of tourism in promoting international understanding and collaboration among nations; environmental protection and preservation of biodiversity; enhancing cultures and valuing heritage; contributing to sustainable development and poverty reduction; and healing wounds of conflict. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {This is an historic overview of conservation in Sub-Saharan Africa from pre-colonial times through the present. It demonstrates that Africans practiced conservation that was ignored by the colonial powers. The colonial market economy combined with the human and livestock population explosion of the 21st century are the major factors contributing to the demise of wildlife and critical habitat. Unique insight is provided into the economics of a representative safari company, something that has not been readily available to Community Based Natural Resources Management (CBNRM) practitioners. Modern attempts at sharing benefits from conservation with rural communities will fail due to the low rural resource to population ratio regardless of the model, combined with the uneven distribution of profits from safari hunting that drives most CBNRM programs, unless these ratios are changed. Low household incomes from CBNRM are unlikely to change attitudes of rural dwellers towards Western approaches to conservation. Communities must sustainably manage their natural areas as "green factories" for the multitude of natural resources they contain as a means of maximizing employment and thus household incomes, as well as meeting the often overlooked socio-cultural ties to wildlife and other natural resources, which may be as important as direct material benefits in assuring conservation of wildlife and its habitat. For CBNRM to be successful in the long-term, full devolution of ownership over land and natural resources must take place. In addition, as a means of relieving pressure on the rural resource base, this will require an urbanization process that creates a middleclass, as opposed to the current slums that form the majority of Africa's cities, through industrialization that transforms the unique natural resources of the subcontinent (e.g., strategic minerals, petroleum, wildlife, hardwoods, fisheries, wild medicines, agricultural products, etc.) in Africa. © 2009 by the authors.},

A new method to analyze reliability is developed. For each label, four aspects are examined: (1) mention of biodiversity; (2) reference to rule of law to assure buyers' confidence; (3) notification of farmers' compliance; and (4) information on ecological impact. The analysis reveals that eco-labels fail to communicate adequately; they do not diminish the information gap between seller and buyer. The main shortcomings of the eco-labels were found in their ambiguity about environmental themes, their failure to assure the buyer about the product's ecological impact, the insufficient information about producers' compliance, and presence of recommendations. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Dutch environmental policies over the past thirty years have expanded through three distinct phases. These policies gradually opened up to engage stakeholders in establishing legislation, formulating implementation plans, and finally jointly defining ecological objectives. Environmental policies became increasingly effective by ensuring the taking on of environmental responsibilities by a growing number of stakeholders. Four unresolved issues present a formidable agenda for environmental policy attention in the next decade: managing CO2 emissions, controlling future infrastructure development, minimising resources use, and reducing the burden on biodiversity. These issues relate to the necessary management of stocks of energy, other non-renewable resources, space, and biodiversity, respectively. Up to now, the issue of the preservation of stocks has not received much policy attention. They are expected to become the new policy issues complementing the traditional emission reduction policies which mainly aim at safeguarding the quality of air, water and soil. It is argued that super-optimizing policies engaging jointly economic, social, and ecological interests, are needed to resolve the issues at stake. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The aim was to base the approach on a scientific framework and to use scientific data to arrive at indicator scores. This has led to a first set of rough impact score data per type of land use on a global level, for two indicators. Remaining subjective elements are related to the restrictions of the approach: only two indicators are chosen as a basis for expressing land use impacts (vascular plant species diversity and free net primary biomass production), a reference state had to be included to incorporate regional differences, and for biodiversity the measure is relative to the local background biodiversity, leading to relatively low sensitivities to changes. Finally, land use impacts are considered to be proportional to the area which is a common understanding in LCA, but not always agreed upon. It is clear that this operationalization is at present only in its teens.},

The study confirmed that managerial issue interpretations and risk propensities were significant influences on organisational actions for biodiversity preservation. More specifically, the biodiversity conservation strategies undertaken by individual companies were influenced by whether or not the managers of these companies interpreted biodiversity conservation as an opportunity or a threat as well as the propensity of these managers to undertake risk on behalf of their companies. This article concludes that opportunity interpretations of biodiversity conservation by managers of biotechnology companies will be translated into proactive environmental responsiveness strategies in uncertain environments only if these managers also exhibit a high risk propensity.},
